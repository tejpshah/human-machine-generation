Not only that, but the tickets were for an outdoor show, which I love much more than being in a crowded stadium. Since he knew I was such a big fan of music, he got tickets for himself, and even a couple of my friends. He is so incredibly nice and considerate to me and what I like to do. I will always remember this event and I will always cherish him. On the day of the concert, I got ready, and he picked me up and we went out to a restaurant beforehand. He is so incredibly romantic. He knew exactly where to take me without asking. We ate, laughed, and had a wonderful dinner date before the big event. We arrived at the concert and the music was so incredibly beautiful. I loved every minute of it. My friends, boyfriend, and I all sat down next to each other. As the music was slowly dying down, I found us all getting lost just staring at the stars. It was such an incredibly unforgettable and beautiful night.",My boyfriend and I went to a concert together and had a great time. We met some of my friends there and really enjoyed ourselves watching the sunset.,90.0
3IRIK4HM3B6UQBC0HI8Q5TBJZLEC61,It seems just like yesterday but today makes five months ago it happened. I had been watching my phone like an owl for the past week. I was waiting for a work related call that my team was waiting for to close a important deal. It wasnt the call I expected though. It was for  my sister was in labor with the twins. My sister is only 7 months pregnant. I got the call shortly after arriving at work. Just as fast I was back out the door and on my way to the hospital. When I arrived my sister had just delivered and I just was in awe. Even though they were a bit small they were mighty. They were the most precious things I had ever seen. I held my niece and nephew and couldnt stop crying. Seeing the tears of joy my sister had was the most warming thing. I am a mother myself but this was the first time for my sister. It was a moment that we could bond and share the warmth of motherhood. I will never forget the look on my brother in law's face as he absorbed the feeling of being  father for the first time. His tears moved the room to tears. It was the most surreal and beautiful moment. The moment had so much of an impact because I can remember becoming a mother for the first time. I am a single mother who is currently enrolled in RN school looking to finish next year. I would do a survey like this again in the future.,"My sister gave birth to my twin niece and nephew.  I visited them in the hospital and held them just after they were born.  They were premature and tiny, but strong and healthy.",150.0

Everyday bills come and new bills come in the mail. I always look at the caller ID now on my phone, just in case. if I owe them money I don't want to answer.

So Lynn, Eric and I were on the last leg of our road trip. We were heading to Acadia National Park. We were having a good time talking about what podcasts we were listening to lately. I mentioned that I started listening to a new true crime podcast. It piqued Eric's interest, so of course he turned around from the front passenger seat trying to get to his phone to pull up the podcast. Lynn was driving and was taken aback by a grown man trying to get to his bag like he was still a kid. It all happened so quickly. I tried to tell Eric that I would grab his phone, and to sit back down. But no he 's up already, and almost had it. That's when Lynn decided to pinch him on the rear end. All hell broke loose. Eric didn't expect it and rolled on his side. Too bad it was the driver's side. Lynn lost control of the car for a moment and we began to swerve towards the trees. Then she regained control. For that moment, all I could think about us crashing into the trees and my parents. Lynn pulled over to steady her nerves and to see if we were okay. We were fine physically but had the one of the biggest scares in our life. Moments later a police car pulled up to check if we were okay. He told us about a diner on one of the exits that we could sit down and recollect ourselves. We thanked him and detoured to the diner. It was still morning so we had plenty of time to get to Acadia National Park.","What happened is that I was on a trip with my friends going to Acadia National Park.

32Z9ZLUT1M6BWPTK368LXKUQWLLOHY,"I wanted to write about one of the best days in the past year. My girlfriend, and I went to the Columbus Zoo about a month ago. It happened to be one of the hottest days recorded in July in the city! We had been planning this trip for weeks, so despite the weather, we decided to stick to our plans. Ashley and I have been working on spending more time together as we both work full-time jobs that prevent us from having date nights. More recently, I have been asked to work overtime on weekends, but this weekend I knew it would be more beneficial to spend time with her. We got to the zoo early before many of the large groups came and grabbed a snack from the snack bar so we could get a head start on seeing our favorite animals. Ashley really enjoyed seeing the elephants and giraffes, while I wanted to see the tigers and lions. The giraffes were running around playing with their young babies who looked as if they had just learned to walk. We were really lucky to see the penguins who were out swimming in the afternoon, but not for very long. It looked like they had gotten full from all of the fish they were being fed and went back into their private area to nap. I couldn't blame them for that! It felt like a much needed day together with my girlfriend. It meant a lot to me personally, as I have been stressed at work and Ashley finds a way to get me talk about some of the things I've been holding in. It was truly a wonderful experience. What was really neat is that the zoo offered free lemonade to their guests once the temperature got above 95 degrees. Ashley must have had a gallon of lemonade that day! I think Ashley had a great time also, as she talked about the animals on the entire drive back home.","Me and my girlfriend went to the zoo on a hot day. We saw many animals like giraffes, gorillas, elephants, snakes, tigers, lions etc.",30.0
37W3JXSD67U5NTSB4S3J0E2E1OJYWP,"I was on vacation because I visit Southeast Asia once in a while. Every few years at least. I was in a small tourist town in Thailand right by Pattaya Beach. I was out fairly late one evening and decided to just roam around the city and take some pictures of the citizens there, the shops, nightclubs etc. I found myself in a rather secluded and dingy part of the city and wasn't sure exactly how to get back to my hotel. I was looking for one of the motorbike taxis but didn't see any. While I was looking around there was a group of Thais, probably in her early 20s and I could tell that they were part of a gang or something like that. I thought for sure I was going to get robbed or beat up or both. They were just across the small street giving me the eye and all of a sudden a taxi went by and I waved at him frantically. He saw me and drove over to where I was at and pick me up. I got back to my hotel safely but I was pretty shaken because I knew things were going to go badly if that small gang caught up with me. I was in that city for another two weeks and I still ventured out and about but I tried to be a lot more careful about what parts I ventured into. I really should have known better as I have been to quite a few other countries and have been in cities that were not very safe. Even though I'm somewhat used to being in these types of environments, they can still be very scary. Tourists have been known to disappear and never show up again. This happens fairly often, especially in countries that have a completely corrupt police force.

I always thought they'd be there for ever. I kinda took it for granted. This all changed about three months or so ago. I hadn't been in contact in a while.

A slap on the wrist--if not, for that empty bag of marijuana in the passenger's side door panels we had forgotten about. ""Do you agree to a search?"" the officer asked. Feeling we had nothing to hide, we simply acquiesced. He began just rummaging through the glovebox, and we knew we were fine. Nothing to find, here. Then he knocked a book out of the door panel and out emerged an empty bag of marijuana with a few flakes clinging to the interior of it. It may have been there for three, five years, who even knows? What we do know, is that was enough to put my buddy, the driver, in court the next morning. The judge was aghast the officers had wasted her time over some amount of marijuana that equated to fish food, and she released him that same morning. We never went back to that city again, because usually a rolled stop sign does not cause a quasi-disaster. We henceforth were much more careful about leaving discarded trash in the car.

351SEKWQS136K6364UAIEVQN9UYMDV,"Three weeks ago, a good friend asked if he could use my car to go to work because he was having trouble. I thought, no problem, and told him it would be ok since I was off that day. I told him just to gas up and get it back safely after his shift. Little did I know that he had other plans in store that involved the law and I was being taken for a ride so to speak. This is the story of how my good friend got arrested and it led to the end of our friendship. After my friend took the car, I got a call from the police about an hour later saying that he was now in prison and I had the option of bailing him out. I did end up bailing him out, but thought - what in the world is going on? It turns out he had been tipped off that something was going on at his work and so when he took my car - thinking they would not recognize him in it - he was still arrested at his job place (during his shift) for embezzlement. His plan had not worked and in the process, I also could not pick up my car right away. Turns out it had to be impounded and I had to pay an additional 80. 00 dollars to get it out of the lot since I was not present at the time of this activity. This whole situation affected our relationship in a number of ways. We are still friends and ok generally, but not as close now. It broke my trust with my friend and made me look around at all things in my life. And secondly, it showed me that people you know, even, will do anything when they are desperate. He had been having money trouble and thought he could get away with this. It turns out cameras at his job place knew different and that is how he was eventually caught.

Our youngest son, who is 6, was at school and had broke his foot. We had to pick him up from school and take him to his doctor. When the doctor saw that he couldn't move his foot, he sent us to the ER to have the foot looked at. Everyone at the ER was very nice. One of the nurses was actually the father of one of my son's friends. It was a small world! We did have to deal with the bad news that he needed to have surgery on his foot. He had smashed the top of his foot and a few of the bones was shattered. We had to explain to the nurses and doctors that the teacher told us that him and a few other boys were playing with desks and one fell on his foot. We got the surgery scheduled and our son was a trooper and didn't really seem phased by it. More than we can say about ourselves because we were scared out of our minds about this!

I liked rock music, she liked jazz. We would argue a lot. We had different friend groups. That was that. This was about 10 years ago. We were both musicians growing up. I played rock music in a band and she was always practicing classical violin. We never paid much attention to each other due to this difference in stylistic taste. When she went to music school 2 months ago I knew she would broaden her musical tastes, and I supported her work. I was extremely surprised last week at her concert. Her jazz band played music that was very angular and dynamic the way that certain rock music is. I asked her about this. She said that she ended up with some members in her band that had rock music tastes like me. She was able to see that as something they had in common to make music about.

After a few worrisome doctor visits, we found out one baby was absorbed by the other. While we were very saddened by the loss of one baby, we were ecstatic about the healthy baby girl my wife was carrying.

3R6P78PK7LXD9L3HFHC26UOBSYBTGW,Over about a week ago I went to go shopping. I went to the local appliance store that's near my home. After arriving at the store I looked around a little bit to see what they had. I went to buy a griddle and there was only one left. I reached to put the last one in my cart. There was another lady there that also wanted a griddle. She stole the griddle from my cart. I was really feeling that move from her so I took it right back. I didn't think things would get that serious over a griddle. After getting the griddle back I browsed around the store a little bit more. I did find a few more things that I ended up grabbing to use.

We went down to the Keys to celebrate a long year of hard work and take some time off together and finally get some quality time. We went down under the water the first day, after a few alcoholic beverages (of course). The fish were awesome, the life was so colorful, but no color more intense than the sunburn I had when we finished up! Oh boy, did I make a mistake forgetting to put on sunscreen that day. I came out like an infrared camera on a hot cherry cobbler -- I am talking molten red. I remember saying, ""well, I'm gonna pay for this hard later on tonight!""

Luckily, the burns subsided rather quickly, and simply glowed an awful red for a few days before turning into a nice tan.

So my friends birthdays was definitely a highlight of the last month, I still have some good memories about it and I smile every time I do. This even showed me different sides of of and what I could be and in this sense it is significant and I would even say life changing.  Some of the other things that I remember is playing darts with people I never met before, we had fun and I felt connected just playing this simple game. I also remember meeting a cute girl, she a blond hair and her name was Anabel, I felt like I known her for ages for some reason, maybe it was the music that made me feel nostalgic but probably it was just a dejavu. The birthdays itself lasted for two days, since it stated on the weekend and my friend could afford an even longer holiday. There were a lot of fun thing to do and the food was amazing, my favorite dish was pizza of course, it was a real Italian pizza from some high end catering service. Also the fresh sashimi was great and tasty. The music was great and the DJ did a great job adjusting to our mood and taking guest requests into consideration. So this birthday was more of a concert than a typical home birthday I am used to and expected to experience.  There were some people whom I've know since I was a kid and it was a very pleasant meeting since we haven't seen each other for ages.  At midnight there was a fireworks show and not like a small fireworks that you can buy anywhere on Halloween but an actual commercial grade fireworks which were huge and loud like it was a major holiday or something, so I really enjoyed that part since you don't see that too often in a common weekend. Since it was a two day celebration and since my friend has a big house, most guests could just stay overnight in one of the bedrooms, it made us all feel even closer and the next morning I felt even more connected to the new people I have met the previous day as well as to my old childhood friends.  Overall it was one of the best birthday celebrations in my life and I really enjoyed it and will probably remember it for a long time if not till the rest of my life.

3P1L2B7AD2BDILCAURNJPCNXD4LLOX,"About a month ago I decided to go on a road trip to the Niagara Falls and Toronto in general in Canada, I was driving from Kentucky, so it was a relatively descent little drive from my place to Toronto.  I decided to go all out when I got up there, since there was plenty of things to do I took my time and truly explored the region of Toronto in general.  The falls were truly breathtaking, and the water was quite cold since it was still winter time when I went.  Once I had my fill of the Falls I also checked out the Chinese cuisines that Toronto had to offer, and I was not disappointed, the food was truly amazing.  The vegetables were fresh, and crisp, while the rice was truly perfect, not too hard, and not too soft, but a good balance of firmness.  I also decided to see the CN tower, and was truly mesmerized by the sheer size of that structure, especially since it was right there, in downtown Toronto.  The sunset was also breathtaking and beautiful, but I don't think that is a strong enough word for how magnificent the sunset truly was.  I loved the trip because I do love exploring and just getting out and doing something different, exploring places I've never been before, and seeing the sheer beauty and raw power of nature, like the Falls provide.  The Chinese food was quite exquisite, as was the CN tower.   I would definitely recommend a trip like this one to my friends because it was such a nice place to go and see.  I think seeing the Falls and the CN tower should be on anyone's bucket list because of just how surreal the tower was, and how serene the Falls were, with that power, and sound of all of the water rushing.  The drive was a little bit rough from Kentucky, since the traffic also isn't kind once I got to Cincinnati, and then from there it just seemed to pick up more when I got up to Toledo and into Detroit.  I think it took me about 14 hours to drive up, I didn't stay at a hotel or anything, although I did take some pit stops to get food, fuel, and other various supplies.  I think I liked seeing the CN tower most, just because of how staggering it looks, right there in downtown Toronto, and also it's proximity to the rest of the city made it a very convenient place to visit while being close to the hotel and restaurants.  The Falls were a little bit far from the city, but not bad.  In closing, I'd like to say that this trip opened my eyes to what North America has to offer in general, and also what our northern neighbors have to offer also in terms of natural and man-made beauty.","We were on a road trip driving from Kentucky, all the way to the Niagara Falls and Toronto.

The quality of the light when you are closer to the equator is just sublime, and the thing that sticks in my mind more than anything else is the sight of the sunrise and sunset during those few days we were there. It felt like stepping into a new world, and I had actually never been anywhere like that even on vacation with my family as a kid. The actual music festival was of course very special, but most of our time was spent on other things. We stayed at a rented place that we pooled our money together for, and it was not all that expensive since there were a few of us in each room. The fishing trip we went on on the second day of our visit was probably the most activity I got the entire time. I didn't feel like working up much of a sweat when I was already soaked in it just the moment I stepped out the front door of our accommodations. The climax of the music festival was something that made me feel like I had goosebumps. One of my favorite electronic musicians was performing and the view of the sunset over the beach as the music built up was just otherworldly. It was not something that I would soon forget, and I think that there will probably be few chances to ever have an experience like this again in the future. One thing I can say is that I met a couple who were very interesting, and we exchanged contact details. So there is a significant chance we may do something together in the future, which is exciting. It is very cool just to talk to random new people you run into in an unfamiliar place.","Island Jam with many bands and many friends and sun and fun.

A few weeks ago, my new neighbor moved in next door. I went to his house, greeted him, and introduced myself. He was very nice, let me in the house, and we talked over a cup of coffee. I was concerned about what type of person my new neighbor might be. Lo and behold, there was absolutely nothing to worry about. He is great.

They were incredibly nice to my family since they moved in, so I'm going to miss them. And had some misgivings about the new people, you know because it meant another black family leaving the neighborhood and another rich yuppie couple coming to further gentrify. Plus there's the fact that there's basically not space between our houses, it can get a little too intimate. It turned out though that my new neighbor is Cara, my very first ""girlfriend."" That's what I called it, but we were 3 or four. I played around with her in her place or my backyard, and for a while, probably until she moved away we exchanged Christmas gifts every year. It was a cute relationship. She lived next door probably until I was 10 or so, I should have put it together sooner that she's related to the Parkers. This was pre-social media so we just completely lost touch. We're connected on Linkedin now though. She's a web developer, just like me, so we had a bunch to talk about. She's got a kid now, a toddler, but I didn't notice a ring when we talked. And she's looking pretty good these days.

Of course I set everything aside to take the call, try to make a good impression, all that. It was crazy though, we were just chatting about how diligent I was when out of the blue he offers me a supervisor position in the department. I didn't even know we had an open spot! I jumped at the offer, naturally, and he said he'd have his secretary bring the papers over shortly. I was trying not to act like a fool so I very humbly thanked him and told him I wouldn't let him down. Once the phone hit the receiver though I confess I danced a little jig. This was going to be a BIG promotion with a lot more pay/benefits, as well as responsibility. The papers to sign arrived and I quickly signed.

It was a letter informing me that the school was re-opening its doors.  This meant I my days of homeschooling were coming to an end!  A year earlier, I had learned that the school my children were going to was closing.  Major repairs needed to be done on the school and I had to find an alternative for my children.  I looked and looked for good alternatives, but there were none.  I live in a small town and the closest school was miles away.  It just wasn't feasable to drive my kids to school when it would take us an hour to get there and an hour to get back.  Hence, my journing into the world of homeschooling began.  I didn't want to homeschool because I knew it would be difficult.  My children were used to the routine of public school and not their mom being their teacher.  How was I supposed to keep them engaged and interested in learning when they are at home?  The distractions in the house were too great with all their electronic devices.  I decided that I had to become two different people, mom and teacher.  I also had to designate an area of the house as the school zone.  Despite this, my children had a hard time adjusting to me being their teacher.  They would wine about the homework and compare me to what it was like when they were attending public school.  I had to remind them over and over why we were doing things they way we were.  I think it took us a good couple of months to really get into the flow of homeschooling.  It wore me out to homeschool.

3WI0P0II62EXHMGY926Z0UKWHJGRDB,So two weeks ago was the 4th of July. I ended up at my grandparent's lake house. It was always nice and peaceful to watch the fireworks outside of the city. We always had a great time at the lake house. Getting to see old friends and family. It was really like a family get together. We did this every year. It had gotten really important because grandma and grandpa were getting old. We all wanted to get ourselves and our kids together for them. We have always been a close family. We spend most holidays together and always enjoy each others company. The 4th of July is everyone's favorite. It's during the summer. The kids can play and swim together. The adults get to catch up and drink. We always have a really nice barbecue.

3QY7M81QH88VD92TS5UGZQONYE2K7X,"Three weeks ago, I woke up with an urge for excitement. I recently got divorced and was ready for big changes in my life. As I lay in bed I wondered what I could do, I felt suffocated for years while married and for the first time in a long time I felt free. Free to do whatever I wanted, I am not getting any younger I thought to myself. I got out of bed and went through my drawer for old diaries, I thought I would relive one of my best memories. Maybe go to six flags or.. as I opened the diary the first page I saw was about some goals I had years ago. In that entry.. travel the world was #2. You see I always wanted to travel the world I but my ex husband put me off of it by telling me we had no money or savings for things like that.  As I stood there looking at my old diary I decided that I wanted to make that my number one goal for right NOW! I went downstairs, made myself a cup of coffee and jumped into the shower. I was exited about the possibility of travelling, I could leave everything behind and start over again some place else. My thoughts went everywhere, I wondered which country I would visit first, if I should look for air bnb or stay at a hotel. How much money do I have and where can I get more money from. With my thoughts all over the place. I got out of the shower, got dressed and started my research. I opened my laptop and went on to youtube and the first video I saw was about a could who sold everything and traveled the world for 9 months. As if this was my fate, I took this as a sign that I too should do this. I called up a friend who is a realtor and asked her to list my three bedroom starter home. She was confused and wanted to go out for a drink but I had allot to do and explained to her that I need to sell my furniture and everything inside my house and if we could have coffee at my house anytime she is free. She came over within an hour and thought I was going crazy. She did help me and knew of a family that might be interested in purchasing my house. Over the next few days I spend my time between cleaning, selling and getting organized. The family who were interested in purchasing came to have a look at it while I was still getting organized. The family were in urgent need of a place to live as they were moving from a different state but nothing could have prepared me for selling my house within 3 weeks and with a cash sale.","I spontaneously listed my home for sale which ended up working out too fast with a cash sale and a 3 week closing,",42.0

This didn't quite happen the way we wanted, and there was a few things that dampened our spirits. Let me start by mentioning the worst part first. Most couples want a perfect wedding but I am sure that doesn't always happen. Here is what happened to us. My wedding morning started off terrible. It was not the best as far as weather goes. There was rain coming down, and thundering. Not only that but started at the same time as my ceremony, I mean exactly! That caused everyone to bring the chairs, and everything else including the food indoors. Then we waited til the storm left until we started it again. We dragged everything outside again instead of just having the wedding indoors. The greatest thing about it is that we saw a rainbow during the time of the marriage vows we exchanged, eventually. This sometimes means an old friend or relative who has passed is looking down upon us in heaven and smiling. That made me happy too.","The morning of my wedding went very well, but it started to thunderstorm at the exact time of my ceremony.

So, it started about 5 months ago. There was an incident in the parking lot of my apartment complex. A young girl was murdered and it was shocking to the entire community. The police investigated the incident and managed to find two suspects that seemed to fit the events of what happened. It seems that the suspects were also accused of murdering a 17 year old girl in the same fashion about a couple of months before this one. Everyone was at ease learning that the perpetrators have been caught. However, a few months after the incident, the suspects were released. The police did not mention why or if they had any additional leads on the situation. To say the least, our community was up in arms about it. There were complaints to the police department, detective in charge and even to the mayor! It was all very confusing. Not only that, the released suspects weren't even charged in the previous incident before this one. We are all still in a state of shock over it. We are not sure what we are going to do. People are acting a little on edge now, hoping the situation doesn't happen again. Sigh...I may think about moving. I'm not sure yet.

Now that our children are growing up, we needed more bedrooms.  We tried to make the current situation work as we are very attached to this first house.  It was a difficult decision, but after much deliberation we decided to sell it.  This happened about four months ago.  We are excited about the new house we are moving into but miss the nostalgic touches of where we reared our children in their younger days.

But we try and look forward to the new memories we will be creating in this new home and set our sights on the future.  This house has a dining nook where we can imagine many family pizza and movie nights going forward.  It also has a fire pit that we can imagine the kids will enjoy having their friends over at as they grow older.  It is important to never grow to attached to worldly things as nothing lasts.

32UTUBMZ7HIWVWZV4QK361LZ7B2VB8,"I've read the full four book lonesome dove series and I consider it to be among the finest of the great western classics. I've also seen the numerous depictions in film of McMurtry's stories. I first discovered the adventures of Call and McCrae in my freshman year of high school. My new girlfriend at the time (who considered herself a bit of a cowgirl) was obsessed with the series. She wasn't exaggerating to say she'd tried her hand at being a cowboy; she once joined an old fashioned cattle drive that took a herd of livestock from idaho to montana by horse. She was so taken by the series and it's characters that she even had her bicep tattooed with a full half-sleeve of McCrae rearing back on a horse. It was quite good work and I was quite jealous. I wouldn't mind going back to visit some of the timeless characters in those novels, they really do hold up in their unflinching depiction of the old american west, blemishes and all. Some of the most profound things I took from the stories were the details surrounding the cultures of the various native american tribes the cowboys encounter along the journeys. It's very interesting to know how the comanches and apaches were so desperately feared, and some other tribes simply were not as their way of life was much different. It also doesn't surprise me that plains native americans would be so tough and willing to fight to defend themselves given the overall harsh environment of north and west texas. One of the most striking moments in the series is when the long time adversary of Call and McCrae, the former chief of the comanches, is on his death-bed and seeks a personal journey to die alone and apart from his tribe. The cowboys have fought him for decades and want nothing but vengeance but they never get it. Instead the reader is treated to a profound moment of acceptance from an incredibly strong-willed man as he ushers himself from his world. It is truly one of my favorite books and having grown up in Texas, I some sense of pride imagining that events as romantic if at time brutal  probably took place. It makes me feel at the very least that Texas is as unique a state as we Texans would like to believe and often proclaim.","I was very sad to have finished a long novel named ""Lonesome Dove"" by Larry McMurtry.

339ANSOTR6OS2TJPBWYDQFEVMBGIKZ,"Now it was time to figure out what to do after college. I had to start a job hunt. I also had to start networking with people i have ever met in order to get job leads. A job search will no doubt have its ups and downs (and ups, downs, and ups again). To help you navigate the job hunt and, ultimately, land your first job, you’ll need some direction. Get started by asking yourself these questions:What kind of job do i want,do i have work experience. Do i even know the industries I'm going to. Since i have no where to live i had to go back to my parents,i couldn't afford a apartment or just pay house rent or pay other bills ,i had to depend on my parents. Next morning i started looking for jobs in the internet and making applications,Calling friends. After a few weeks i was offered a job in a manufacturing company. A first job is special. There are a couple of reasons for this: the experience is burned in one’s memory, it gives you the practice needed to fulfill other positions, and it teaches you about the value of money. Of course we do jobs around the house when we are young, like cleaning dishes, vacuuming, and doing laundry, but working for others for money gives off a different feeling. It was a cloth  manufacturing company. After a few weeks of practicing and getting grip on the work, my supervisor decided that I should work solo because she saw confidence in me, and I was confident as well that I could work by myself because I knew exactly what to do. When I started to work solo, I was given more heavy and hard work such as instead of ticketing price tags on shirts and t-shirts, now I had to ticket price tags on heavy jeans, jackets, school-bags, etc. I also had to pack those items in the boxes depending on the price, weight and size of the items. Once, I packed those items in the boxes by using tap-gun, I also had to put those heavy boxes on pallet and move it by using roller to a place where other employees would lift those boxes and put in trucks, which will send it to the stores. Despite being the youngest employee other employees were very friendly. Whenever i need help they were ready to help me out. After three moths i was promoted to higher position and my salary also increased since i was very hardworking and focused. Life was starting to feel better i had to move from my parents house and rent my apartment,i started also paying my bills is not that easy but i had to struggle and do other par time jobs. I had to also save in order for me to do other courses and grow my career.","After four long years of college, my friends and I crossed the finish time.

Leading up to our graduation, every day was jam packed with things to do.  We were cramming for exams, touching up final papers, analyzing data for research projects. And that was just for school. We also had to find time to apply for jobs, so many jobs.  And of course we couldn’t neglect each other. We went out every weekend.  We were finally all 21 and didn’t have to worry about fake ids, so we really took advantage of the full range of bar selections across the city. We felt like we were finally growing up and finally ready to enter the real world. Graduation day two weeks ago was the culmination of all of that.  We partied like we never had before, and we finally didn’t have to stress about waking on time the next day battling a hangover to get to class. After that, though, the dorms closed.  We all had to leave.   I went back to my family’s house for a while, and the whole world seemed to stop.

It's the time of year when all you want to do is go to the beach and enjoy your freedom and youth. The time of year when your cares follow the snow and cold weather; you're not sure where they went but they are not missed. After seeing all this winter snow and being holed up in the house all winter, the need to see the ocean and deep sea fishing became overwhelming. At the time, about 4 months ago, my car was 12 years old and not in the best of shape; hell, my car manufacturer, Saturn, is no longer even in business so how can I trust it to make it from Chicago to south Florida and back! The prudent thing to do would be to take my mom's car. My first problem was that she doesn't want me to use it. I don't see why we can't use it while she is out of town, she won't even know! If I gas it up after I am done with it, she would be none the wiser to my plan. In fact, I would even go so far as to change the oil of her car. It was decided then; we will take my mom's car! My next problem was my puppy. I can't leave a puppy by herself in the house while I am gone. My best option is to take her with us on the trip.

We all piled out of the car and looked at the engine. It took us a long time to get it fixed but ultimately we were able to fix the issue. As we piled back into the car, I noticed our puppy was missing. We left the door open and couldn't find her anywhere in the car. As it was starting to get dark, we went to the car to get a flashlight and when digging it out of the back of the car, who did we find sleeping under the gear, my puppy. So sweet and tired from the trip, she was cuddled up against the warmth of the blanket under the fishing poles and gear; she found the one place in the back that was perfect for her size.

They were roaming around the beach and enjoying the tides. My relatives were taking sun bath and were ready for other set of enjoyment.

I had a dream about her last night. We met up and it was... nice. Polite. I mean, I didn't slap her, so already I'd say that's a pleasant dream. I'm kidding, but only sort of. It's actually the first time I dreamed of her in the last four months, since we stopped speaking.  I've been rolling the incident around in my head over and over again, trying to think how it could have gone differently. I talked to mom after it happened and she was kind but firm, which sounds about right, eh?  Mostly, she said I shouldn't have let the issue get so hot before dealing with it and that's why it exploded. Exploded, ha. That's an understatement. My bae since Kindergarden and now we never talk. It makes me so flipping sad sometimes, even though she was way out of line. Oh, I hear my mother's voice in my head again reminding me that I was out of line too.

I have been stressed non-stop, between orchestrating the movers and rental trucks.  I had to pack up the entire house alone, and ended up selling some items, as there was no more space on the truck.  I was so worried about the overage charges that I have heard those movers charge when you have mores things then you are supposed to.  My cat is older, and I didn't want to stress him with the relocation, so I had to let him stay with my family back in Denver.  That was one of the hardest parts of this move.  Then when I got to my girlfriends place, she has a cat.  And it hates me, almost as much as I dislike him.  I followed the truck over 12 hours, driving throughout the night.  I was so tired.

Maybe people think I should have waited another 10 years but there are key people in my life I wanted to witness us renew our vows and as morbid it may sound, possibly will not be with us another ten years. Added addition to the ceremony is  our lovely 6 year old daughter who were our flower girl. I bought a simple, yet pretty gown and my husband got a tailored made suit. Our daughter got the prettiest dress ever and we set the date over the winter on the beach in our local city, Miami.  The ceremony was beautiful and my husband and I expressed our love to each other and the blessing,m our daughter we have created. We had a small gathering following the ceremony in our backyard where our guests can mingle. Everyone goes to our home and good food, music, and drinks is  served. The open bar was a hit, maybe too much of it as few of the guests, including my husband got sloppy drunk. While others danced with drunk(ness) on the dance floor, including my husband, one, my ""lovely"" uncle step it up a notch and started to flirt with other women, while aunt is present and gotten rowdy. I was somewhat embarrassed and my aunt came to me to say she will handle it and taken my inebriated uncle outside to calm down. Luckily all this transpired shortly after my daughter went inside the house  with a older cousin whom we asked to babysit my daughter. Aside from my husband who could not remember half of the night and my crazy uncle who had to sleep away his liquor, overall the wedding was beautiful and everyone enjoyed themselves. I got another chance to celebrate my 10th wedding anniversary and once again fall in love with husband.

George has two daughters that are five and eight.  And, I have one daughter that is eight and one son who is four.  My son Ryan is a very active and curious little boy.  We were married in a gazebo at a park.  The park was filled beautiful gardens and a lake with a water feature in the middle.  Our wedding day was on a beautiful summer day.  During the ceremony the local ducks decided to join us.  The ducks made a mess on the floor of the gazebo.  As we were saying our vows, Ryan noticed the ducks and decided to check them out.  He dashed to the area of the gazebo, where the ducks were.  As he ran toward them, he slipped and fell in the duck's poop and tripped over my grandmother's feet, soiling her shoes.  By that time the ducks decided to leave and they waddled towards the lake.  When Ryan got up from tripping over my grandmother's feet, he chased after the ducks.  By this time we saw Ryan chasing the ducks and going towards the lake.  George and I stopped saying our vows to each other and chased after Ryan.  But, it was too late to catch him before he got to the lake.  To our dismay, Ryan fell in the lake.  Thank goodness the water was not deep at the edge and we were able to get to him safely.

He would apologize like he had done something minor, like forgetting to read me a bedtime story. He just acted like what happened was something that he could apologize and move on from. I will never forget the way he dismissed his own behavior. However, his behavior ended up ruining mine and my siblings' lives. I fear that if I ever see him again or that if he has more children in the future, the abuse will continue once more. I hope that he does not remarry a woman that has children of her own as well. I fear that if he becomes involved with a wife or other children, he will abuse them as well. The abuse has been significant to my life because it has led to a chain of events that have landed me in foster care. After a teacher noticed the bruises, she told officials. Officials investigated the situation of my home life and immediately determined that I was not safe at home with my father. Since my mother is not in the picture, I was placed immediately into foster care. This did not only affect me, however. My siblings were abused and place into foster care as well.

Of course we accepted and we looked at each other when we got home and wondered what supplies we might need. We had no idea what to bring nor what to expect. So we did the best we could considering we didn't even have sleeping bags much less a tent. We arrived at the campsite where our friends were already. The place was serene and had a good atmosphere but the heat was unbearablly hot. There was no place to hide from the heat. We didn't move much during the day at all and hoping that the sun would go down quicker than usual. We took short hikes around the campground just to see what type of facilities were there. Not much in the form of relief from the heat. Well the sun finally went down and then we had to deal with the mosquitoes. I hate mosquitoes. Fortunately we did bring insect repellant and our friends saw that we were a bit frustrated about the whole thing. Our friends started a bonfire and that was wonderful. That took away the mosquitoes and was warming the coolness of the night. We drank beer and told stories of our past and then had a good time from that point on. I am glad it lasted only two days because I just am not cut out to be a big time camper like my friends. Me and my wife were surprised at the empathy that our friends took on us. I felt that they had been in the same position when they first started out camping as well. Me and my wife learned a lot about ourselves and our friends during that lost weekend of our lives.

I was surprised at how much you could learn and how complex it could be but I didn't let it scare me; I continued in my quest to learn more. I was intrigued by just how many wild foods there were out there available for us to eat. It made me realize that people aren't using the natural resources we have and that there are a lot of things that are going to waste just because we don't know it's available to us. After a week of doing extensive research, I decided to go on a hunt and see exactly what I could find. I drove about an hour away to a location that was plentiful of forest and wildlife that I thought would suit me for my foraging needs. As I walked through the woods, I stumbled upon things I had not recognized from my research, so I had to use my best judgement about whether or not this was something that could be edible. I found a patch of wild berries that looked good so I decided to try my luck and eat one. They were very sweet and did not have a bitter taste, so I ate a few more before continuing on my way. Further on my travels, I saw some wild plants so I decided to pick them and take them home with me to see what I could do with them. This was turning out to be quite the interesting adventure. I heard a rustling noise behind me so I abruptly looked over my shoulder and realized that I had entered someone else's territory. Instead of seeing a person like I expected, I saw a beautiful deer standing behind me. It didn't run away like I thought, but just looked at me inquisitively, stopped to take in the sights and smells of nature, and then slowly walked away. At that moment, I thought to myself, people and animals aren't all that different. We are all here for the same reason; survival and to try and protect what is ours. As it started getting dark, I figured it was time to pack up and take my findings home. My stomach was feeling a little bit queasy and I was hoping it wasn't the berries I ate from earlier!","I learned about food foraging from self-study, reading and videos. This expanded myself and my understanding of the world around me.",150.0
3TUI152ZZC93DQLMGUX4U29IW0KQ1S,I was so upset by my landlady! Six weeks ago I went to go to my job. I have a job that requires me to be there 5 days a week. I headed out to my car as always in the early morning. Much to my surprise my car was not there! Can you imagine how my heart sank? I had no idea what happened to my car. Worse of all I had no way to get to my job on time. I came to find out that my landlady did not approve of the way I parked in the lot. Since this upset her she decided to have my car towed! Instead of calling me first she just made a knee jerk decision and called to have my car towed. I had to incur the expenses of the impound yard. To recover these costs I have decided to sue my landlady. There was no reason for her to go to that extreme and I am certain I will recover the costs. I am not someone who is sue happy but since she won't reimburse me I have no other choice. This could have all been avoided had she just kindly called me. We all have our assigned parking spaces and she knew the car was mine.,My car was towed to an impound yard.  It was a nasty move on the part of my landlady.  I had to sue to recover my expenses.,42.0

We were driving down the road through the the wooded area when we saw bright lights off in the distance. These lights were so blinding that we had to pull over. We got out to investigate because there are no buildings or facilities in that part of town. Just when we got out we saw a disc shaped object lift off from where the lights were shining. We couldn't believe what we saw and quickly took out our phones to capture the moment. The object kicked up wind as it took to the air but their was an eerie silence emitting from it. It hovered in the air for about thirty seconds before jetting off over the horizon at speeds that don't seem possible. The wind died back down as the UFO left our sight. We all just stood in disbelieve at what we witnessed. We uploaded the video to social media and my friend managed to stream a bit of the ship live on Instagram. The footage garnered so much attention and views from people all around the world. Many people in the comments thought it was a hoax but we told them that it was all real.

Although he looked quite young, he claims he has been teaching math for 15 years. I have always been very good at math, so I was looking forward to learning a lot in this class. Of course the first few weeks easy because most of the material was review. However, Mr. Bolton insisted that everything been done exactly as he wanted it. For example, we had to right our name in the upper right hand corner of each assignment. If it was not written there he would take of points. In about the middle of October, when we started getting into the new material, things took a turn for the worse. Mr. Bolton insisted that the students were required to show the work for how we solved the problems. He would not except the fact that this is old fashioned way of doing things.

I've already told you about all the fun we had, how amazing the Falls themselves were, but I haven't told you about my own personal fall.  I guess I've been looking over my shoulder, still nervous that they might change their mind and come after me and lock me up.  It's just not like me to get in trouble with the law. The Falls were good, the shopping was good, but something happened when we went out to eat that first night.  Maybe it was the excitement of seeing the Falls, the rush of all that water, the exciting splash of water on my arms, making the hair stand on end.  The gentle kiss of the wet breeze on my face.  We decided to spend a little more than usual on dinner and go someplace fancy. It wasn't just fancy, it was elegant, refined.  It was the most romantic dinner we'd been to since our honeymoon.  We started with a glass of champaign, split a bottle of red wine during the meal, and then got lured by the waiter into trying something afterwards, a nice Canadian port he recommended. It was amazing.  Like velvet on our tongues.  I've never been really, really drunk before like that.  We stumbled back to our room and had an amazing night.  Something really came alive in my husband, and in me.  It was my first time with a hangover, but it was a night of many firsts, for both of us. We loaded up with several bottles of that port before heading home again.  I'm always nervous crossing the border, thinking about how hard it was for grandma.  Maybe part of me feels like there's always a chance they may change their mind about us, see the mistake they made with her, and keep us all out forever.  My heart was pounding when they pulled us over for inspection, and stopped dead when they found the port.  It was too much! I've never been so ashamed.  The looks the guards gave us were devastating.  I may not have a criminal record from this, but I feel permanently unsettled, like I enjoyed myself too much to live up to the legacy of my grandmother.","My husband and I went on vacation to Canada.

Knowing how to say goodbye, and dealing with the sense of loss that can follow, is part of being a parent. The pain of separation can go far beyond simply missing your son or daughter after they're gone. Some parents feel a very real sense of grief and loss; a lack of purpose or control. Because having a child leave home to go to university is regarded as a measure of success – a sign that you have prepared them for the world – the downsides are often not adequately acknowledged. Parents are told dismissively to buck up, get a hobby or a cat and start seeing friends more – but ""empty nest syndrome"" can hard to cope with. A myth that surrounds empty nest syndrome is that it is only applicable to stay-at-home mothers, who have shaped their life around the nurturing of their children. In reality, it can affect any kind of parent, whether you have a separate career or not. Lillian Little says: ""I thought I would never suffer from empty nest syndrome – I'm a college professor with a PhD – I thought only pathetic women with no life beyond their kids had no problem with this."" But Little was afflicted by a sense of ""life-altering loss"".Having a job outside of the house can provide structure and distraction, but by no means immunisation. Family Lives found that so many parents experience pain at an empty nest that they set up a specific advice line for the problem. Making a plan for the initial goodbye gives a framework and can be comforting. It's worth sorting out the practical aspects in advance. Are you going to drop them off in their new home, or are they getting there by themselves? How will you travel, where will you park, what public transport will you use?

I wanted to go somewhere less touristy and with more culture, but Tom has wanted to visit the Bahamas ever since his best friend Alex went with her husband. I acquiesced, of course, because I'll do anything to make Tom happy. And he was. He was in Heaven for that entire week. And so, I was pleasantly surprised to find out, was I.The resort was the most luxurious accommodation I have ever experienced. We didn't have to lift a finger for the whole week. New drinks were brought to us at the moment our glasses had become dry. The beach and the water were so beautiful. The water was a vivid turquoise color, just like you see in the commercials. The weather was perfect except for one day, when it rained hard. Tom and I used that time to go to a local cultural museum, which I felt right at home at. I enjoyed learning about the history of the Bahamian people. There were several events that we enjoyed participating in during our stay. Every night there was a dinner where you could eat with other couples. We made these wonderful friends, Jim and Sue, who were our companions throughout the trip. My favorite events were the late night parties. There was dancing under the light of the fire from the tiki torches. The DJ was talented and played a great mix of music, including hits and deep cuts. Everyone was in a cheerful mood, and I found it contagious. My favorite event was the carnival that we attended a few miles away from the resort. There were so many elaborate costumes, amazing food, and live music. Coming home from the trip, I felt utterly relaxed and rejuvenated.

Though the prospect in front of me seemed much harder than in the past. Now I had to work a job on top of going back to school and that seemed like a lot of hard work. I knew though that if I didn't go back to school, not only would I regret it, but I would be stuck where I was possibly forever. I started by making sure that my job would allow me to go back to school and thankfully they were happy to give me lighter workloads and flexibility. So I started planning my classes and getting ready to work hard. The first few weeks were tough even though I felt I was prepared. Too many times I didn't get enough sleep because I had to study and even had a few night classes. Even with flexible work schedules I still had problems with keeping up with my two responsibilities. However after the first month I felt like my mind and body had adjusted and I was working harder and better. I was also learning many new things in school and I felt I not only could do this, but thrive. All the work and studying made me realize I could do more than I thought I could. I did feel some shame that I didn't do this earlier, but the important thing was that I was doing it now.

About two months ago, I had a hard day at work, my boss gave me a second warning about being late and warned me that next time I would be fired. On my way home from work that day, I stopped off at the liquor store and bought a jug of vodka. When I got to my car, I immediately started drinking, I felt so hopeless and like I had nothing to live for. I felt like my boss hated me and it seems like she lets other coworkers get away with a lot more stuff than me. All of my bills are late, my pay check barely covers my bills.  I started the car and started driving, I was going to go drive my car off the make out hill. I got to the top of the hill and my phone rang. My moms picture was staring at me. I knew I couldn’t leave her, she would be devastated if I took my own life. I knew where I could get help, a friend of mine had went to a crisis stabilization unit a few weeks ago because she had started cutting her self again. I googled the address and followed the directions. When I arrived to the parking lot of the init it was a small white building with red and yellow tulips in front. I was ashamed and didn’t want to go in. There was a knock on my car window. I looked up to see a guy in a blue polo shirt looking at me very concerned. I opened the door and he asked if I was alright. I told him I wasn’t and I needed help. He said he would walk me in and help me check in. I was taken into a room and a lady checked that I didn’t have any drugs or weapons. I was given hospital pajamas and told to put them on.

My parents had just gotten a divorce and my dad decided he wanted to move to Florida, leaving my mom, whom I didn't have the best relationship with, and I, in Atlanta, GA. I've always been a daddy's girl but I kept a lot from my dad to maintain my innocence in his eyes. Following my parents' divorce, I started hanging out later, I was drinking, I was using marijuana, and I was promiscuous. My grades suffered and I had begun spending time with multiple guys just for the fun of it. I was filling a void that my dad could no longer fill. Though I was spending time with multiple guys, I had strong feelings for one, Joshua. Joshua was smart, funny, a good listener, popular, handsome, a gentleman, and still a tough guy. I knew I was a lucky girl so eventually I dropped the other guys and committed myself to Joshua. But prior to commitment, I made the mistake of sleeping with both Joshua, and another guy, Corey, around the same time. Two months later, I realized my period was late, I was nauseous all of the time, and I had weird sensations in my body that were flu like. I told my best friend Ashley at the time about my symptoms and she told me that she would go to the dollar store with me the following day to get a pregnancy test since they were just as reliable as the name brand tests, but cheap. The next day, Ashley and I went to the Dollar Tree and purchased three pregnancy tests just in case I messed one up. I took the test at her house since her parents weren't home and I didn't want to risk running in to my mom at home. It was at this time that I found out that I was pregnant. I was scared, worrying about what I would do with a baby, and wondering whose baby it was. My mom was disappointed, I couldn't tell my dad myself that his princess was pregnant, and while Ashley was excited, it wasn't enough support to raise a baby. I needed stability, support, a job, personal growth, and I needed to finish school. My only hope was Joshua but he was not too happy about the fact that I was unsure of who the baby's father was and respectfully told me that he wanted nothing to do with me but that he would be a friend and see my decision to the end with me. Corey also wanted nothing to do with me, as far as he was concerned, I was a hoe. I felt like my only option was to terminate my pregnancy. I cried days before ending my pregnancy, during the process, and days following the procedure. I was broken, and I felt alone and helpless because I never wanted to have an abortion but I had no one. Now five years later, I find out that my dad would have been willing to help me raise my baby had he have known I was with child, but neither me nor my mom mentioned it to him.

Immediately she caught my attention since I was very attracted to her, but I simply went back to my work once a moment or two had passed. I was writing an email to a coworker when she walked by again. I looked out of the corner of my eye to see that she was heading toward the break room. I decided that the email could wait so I decided to mosey on over to the break room myself to get a cup of coffee, and if she so happened to be in there then that would be just great. I walk in and notice her standing at the coffee machine pouring herself a cup. I walk up and wait for her to be done when she goes to get a packet of sugar to add to her coffee when she notices the container is empty. She doesn't seem to know where the extras are stored so I open up and tell her that the spare sugar packets are stored in the cabinet above the sink. She thanks me and walks over to the previously mentioned cabinet. She thanks me and introduces herself as Pam, and I nod my head and tell her my name is Tim.

3TK8OJTYM27YZQ05NV241LQPE7VPVD,"The day had come, it was my wedding day, and I had been so freaking nervous about all of the circumstances surrounding it. I was freaking out pretty hard when it dawned on me that hey, I was marrying the girl of my dreams. The way we had met was spectacular, and totally happenstance. We had both been at a Spiritual guidance gathering at a retreat in the woods, and from the moment I saw her I knew that I needed to talk to her. I approached her with a soft smile on my face and we caught eyes, and I could immediately tell that she was the one. Now here we are, two and half years later, and I'm struggling with my damn tie and sweating and just overall a nervous wreck. Like I said, I realized that this is the girl of my dream, and the way we met was just serendipitous. I waited at the altar with a lump in my throat, waiting for her beautiful face to be led down the aisle by her Father. When that moment arrived, I was starstruck, I damn near fell over due to how beautiful she actually was, I hadn't actually seen her in about three days, due to the bachelorette party, and of course the tradition of the groom not seeing the bride before this moment on their wedding day. As soon as she reached the altar, I felt all the panick in my heart dissolve. We smiled at eachother and took one anothers hands as we looked towards the priest to begin the ceremony. I couldn't wait to make her mine, to bring her into my life as my wife, and I knew she felt the same way. It was absolutely lovely, and everything I could have expected and more. The reception was a blast as well, plenty of people laughing and telling happy stories of the two of us, and wishing us an absolutely blissful life together. That being said, I think we can leave the honeymoon out of this, because that might get a little racy, even for you diary. When we arrived home from the honeymoon, and I had to return to work, it was with great disdain that I left my new bride home alone, though I knew I would be back to see her in only eight short hours. I made haste to the office to begin my day and effectively my new life. When I walked into the office, I was immediately called into my supervisors office and I thought trouble immediately, only to be relieved that there was no trouble at all. In fact, it had been a promotion waiting for me for all of my diligent work and loyalty to the company. Could this get any better? I mean, I have had some pretty damn good luck all things considered, but is it really luck? Or is it this result of my hard work, patience and determination in succeeding in this life? I choose to believe that it's probably a mixture of both. I am more than pleased with the way my life is turning out so far!",In my life there was most memorable day is my wedding day and in my office there was promotion for me in my office it is so respectful moment in my office.,120.0

I am not sure what exactly caused him to pick up the habit but I do know he had a rough childhood. One day I walked into the garage and saw that he had completely rearranged it and I noticed a small glass pipe on one of the tables. I had never seen this type of pipe before but I did notice the residue built up inside. I confronted him about this and he admitted that he had smoked some earlier in the day and started cleaning up the garage. I asked him how long he had been using and he said he started recently. I had noticed some changes in his behavior recently. He started to stay up later and later at night. At times I would wake up in the morning and he was still awake. I thought he was stressed out because of work or that he needed to catch up on an assignment but I did not think much of it. Once he admitted to smoking meth I told him he needed to get help. This is a slippery slope and I didn't want it to get to an extreme point. This was 5 years ago. He went to rehab for a few months and everything seemed fine. He came back and attended some NA meetings and met some people that could help him out with his problems. Then he started acting odd again. He came home at odd hours of the night and when I confronted him, he became very defensive and refused to answer my questions. Then the arrest came. As a result of him going to rehab he lost his job. I had to pick up two shifts in order to make ends meet. When he came back he had a hard time holding a job. He bounced around from job to job until he met up with some people at NA who set him up with a decent job at a local fast food restaurant. He had been working there for 3 years and then he had the bright idea of stealing some money from the register to feed his habit. Three months ago, the manager confronted him about this, and he was arrested that very same day.

On the day of her birthday we decided to take it easy and swim by the pool. We ordered breakfast and mimosa's and the staff brought it to us. The meal consisted of poached eggs, hashbrowns, biscuits, and gravy. They even brought us a fresh bowl of fruit. We decided to take a walk after we ate and picked up shells on the beach. Just seeing her smile made me happy. That afternoon we decided to have a short nap before the real fun began. She made sure to fix her hair and make-up for our big night out. Her dress was, as blue as, the ocean and made her eye's shine. I decided on a nice blue polo shirt and a pair of cargo shorts. Around 5 we departed our room for dinner at the resort's restaurant. The atmosphere was serene and romantic. I handed my wife her gift and when she opened up the box tears fell from her eyes. It was a special bracelet with our children's birthstones. She has been such a great wife and mother that the gift seem a little cheap. We ordered our food which consisted of crab legs, salad, and clam chowder. We wanted it to be a light meal since we were heading the beach club for a night of drinking and dancing. The servers surprised her at the end of dinner with a big slice of chocolate cake and sang happy birthday. Her face seemed to turn red as they danced around the table. After paying the bill we jumped in a taxi and went out to dance. Carlos was a small dance club on the south side of the resort. We were able to get our own VIP table and they brought us a bucket of champagne.

It was a lot of fun because we could just talk together. I have never been able to spend that much alone time with my wife because we are constantly hanging out with our children. It was very nice to be able to get away. As the vacation went on we decided we wanted to do some sort of physical activity. We did a high ropes course right off the beach that made me a bit nervous, but that my wife loved it. I don't like heights that much and many objects were swinging at a high height. I was able to jump from space to space, but often would fall and dangle from the top. We also decided to go on a quick cruise that took us out at sunset to watch some dolphins swimming in the ocean. The sunset was absolutely beautiful and we didn't see many dolphins, but the company from being next to my wife was the best. Almost every night we would go dancing too. There was a bar that had a huge dance floor and lots of people would come out and we would all just dance together and chill. It was great to be with my wife, but also be surrounded by other people. We didn't want this vacation to end, but eventually we had to leave and return to our kids so we had to.

I went looking for cookies in the cabinets but once again I could not find any. I was starting to panic at this point. There was no one else in the house that could help me if I blacked out.

While he was torn about the whole thing, it made me think about the times I spent with her. She took good care of me even though I wasn't technically family and we had a lot of good times together. That was a long time ago, though, and that probably made it easier for me to settle with the fact that I could not even make time to attend her funeral.

It's not often that I completely embarrass myself in front of all my coworkers, but I definitely succeeded in doing that this past holiday season. About 6 weeks ago I went to a backyard cookout hosted by Mike. When I got there, Mike surprised me by asking me to watch his son during the cookout. I was pretty surprised because I didn't think Mike trusted me that much, but I guess he felt comfortable asking me because he knew I was a parent too. As the cookout started, I began talking to Mike's son and trying to entertain him. It was difficult to keep up with his energy, because he was 7 years old. Kids at that age seem to just have endless amounts of energy and always talk so fast it's hard to get a word in.

When I was finished drinking, I felt a lot more at ease and I wasn't getting stressed as much at the task of being responsible for Mike's son. I said to myself, what the heck, and decided to have a few more beers. By the third beer, things were getting a bit out of control.

My relationship with my parents also suffered because the weight of the situation made for raw feelings and emotions which we took out on each other. Situations like this should bring people closer together but in this case it was horrible for us all in every way. I still harbor a lot of anger toward my mother because I feel that she is not helpful to my father's condition. I think she brings a lot of unneeded stress and I feel disgusting even thinking that but it is true. I really feel her attitude and poor coping skills are shortening my dad's life. I tried speaking to her about it but it resulted in hurt feelings and anger.","I needed to drive my parents to and from the hospital over the course of several months.

There was so much food it made me feel a little guilty even about those they don't have enough to eat. The kids were in the back yard playing ball, some were exploring the wooded area, others were on the swing set. It was almost like a school playground there were so many of them.

3P1L2B7AD2BDILCAURNJPCNXD2UOL5,"5 months ago, I found out that my best friend John Smith attended a Proud Boys rally.  We had grown up together, going to grade school and later middle school and high school.  While we ended up living in different states after college, I thought I knew him very well.  He didn't come across as the type to go to one of those rallies or one who would support their ideology.  His social media didn't even provide any clues as to this.  I found out because another friend hit me up about some weird pictures on John's Facebook profile.  It turns out, he had created a setting to hide this from most of his friends and family.  He was only posted that stuff to his new 'friends'.  His old friends and family received a 'sanitized' version of his life.  This version was free from the hateful rhetoric on his unfiltered page.  He was obviously conflicted about it, or he would not have been filtering it from others.  I confronted John about it, as we had always been accepting of others and tolerant towards all but the intolerant.  On the phone call, he got really quiet for a second.  Then said that he was actually glad this came out and that he had long felt I was a 'naive libtard' and that I needed to wise up.  I was crushed that a friend had been lured down what I feel is a dark path of xenophobia and hatred.  I had no idea.  It pains me, but he has since cut off contact.  As a result of this, I have made a point to keep in closer contact with distant friends and to always let them know that I am there for them if they need to talk with someone.

The day she gave me the money, I had put it in my wallet, and left my wallet sitting on my dresser.  That same night, a friend of mine had come over, saying he wanted to talk.  He's been having financial problems lately do to the fact that he has gotten addicted to pain medication.  He came over, and we talked for quite some time.

They had a large exhibition of folk art, which we enjoyed. They even had some van Goghs. We stayed there for hours, enjoying the beauty of creation. We then went to the Magnificent Mile. We enjoyed all the departments stores. We spent too much money but we had a lot of fun. As we walked back to the hotel along Lake Michigan. We saw big storm roiling the lakes waters.

We packed lunched for that one. Because the kids wouldn't have lasted a whole day otherwise. We actually fell from our canoes which was a bit embarrassing but the water was great. We're back home now. It was a great trip which we'll remember for a while. I hope the kids remember it, but we surely did. I'm not sure when we'll have the chance to go on another one of those.

Those adventures we went on together, the vacations we shared, the silly laughs at the dumbest things... just sharing everything together. I think I am now starting to fully come to grasp with the idea that I do not need you to survive or be the best version of myself. For the longest time I thought I relied on you, that the image of ""us"" is what kept me strong and instilled confidence in me. Having made it through the remainder of the summer and single, I was able to spend a lot of time focusing on me. At first I thought perhaps it was because I wasn't good enough, or that I was doing something wrong. I can clearly see now that it is much more the idea of us both holding on to more of a perfect but unrealistic version of us being together. Perhaps you had seen this first... maybe you saw this a while ago, yet for me I am now just starting to see it.

By this I mean that certain rooms like the kitchen and bathroom were up-to-date and I didn't have to do much to fix these places to be more to my liking.

To be honest, all of these things make em feel very safe. It is in a great neighborhood where I know all of the people who live in the community and even the association people are friendly and nice to all of us that live here. The most memorable thing that I recall in this house is finding it to begin with. Before getting this house, there was a period of time in my life where I was deeply into the movies that centered around beautiful natural phenomena, like red tide or the aurora borealis. After praying that I could find someplace good to live with all the bells and whistles I wanted, I went onto Zillow to find my prefect place. I found a place, someplace gorgeous that had all the amenities I was looking for at a price I loved. In a good area, I deigned to look at what the street was called and lo and behold the house was on Aurora Lane. I knew this house was meant for me and it showed that my religion always comes though for me. I do believe there is a God up there and this experience has shown me that it is indeed the case, the way things matched up so surprisingly nicely and personally to me.

3WMOAN2SRCJYW5OS7GPCXWLTQVENVF,Five months ago my boyfriend surprised me with a trip to Disney world.  He had never planned a vacation without me so I was very shocked but excited.  Neither of us had ever been to Disney world before so it would be a first for both of us.  The day started out hitting up some of the rides.  Mid day we were both a little tired so we went back to the hotel to rest up and shower.  He had made dinner plans for us that evening.  We both rested and got cleaned up and then headed back to the park.  He had made reservations near Cinderella's castle so that we could watch the fireworks as we ate.  It was so beautiful and romantic to see the fireworks light up the castle.  As dinner was wrapping up the waiter came out with two glasses of champagne.  I was so caught up in watching the fireworks that I failed to notice that my boyfriend was now down on one knee.  I couldn't believe what was happening!  My mind was whirling as I screamed out yes!  I jumped up to hug my boyfriend.  The next thing I know I hear some familiar voices calling out congratulations behind me.  I turned around to see my two best friends behind me.  My boyfriend had flown in my two sisters so they could be hear to celebrate with us.  That had to be the most memorable part of the evening seeing them.  I couldn't believe that he planned this whole romantic evening himself.  I also couldn't believe that my sister's kept this secret from me.  I just thought I was taking a simple weekend getaway with my boyfriend.  I never had a clue that I would head home two days later engaged to be married.

3BEFOD78W7FTKAKDBJ9PBRWHWH6M4J,"About a week ago I was heading home after I went to starbucks for my daily coffee, it was a rainy afternoon and the street was quite busy. Lots of cars drove by, kicking up water and dirt as they sped through. I was in a rather bad mood as I dont very much care for the rain in Seattle. As I was walking home, I noticed an old man sitting on a bench, he had dirty unkempt gray hair hidden by a rather old beanie. A dark tan coat dirtied by years of reliance, his face was pale with grime throughout. He had been on the bench for quite a while, I'd seen him around town before. As I walked closer, I could see tears rolling down his cheeks. He was crying, silently, of course. The look of utter misery in his face prompted me to inquire into why exactly he was crying. I had never asked someone why they were crying like this before, I didnt exactly know how to approach the man so I awkwardly shambled close to him and sat down.""What's wrong sir? I noticed you were crying."" I asked softly.""I'm extremely sick, I went to the free clinic and I've found that I have no chance of life more than a few months. That's whats wrong, now if you'd leave me be, I'd appreciate it.""He looked quite defeated in that moment, like nothing mattered in that moment. I decided the only real thing I could do was hand him my cup of coffee, as a small reminder of some good in the world.""I can't offer much to your situation, but here you go, a fresh cup. Enjoy what little time you have left, man."" These words probably sounded more offensive than anything, he silently took the cup and muttered a thanks. I felt slightly better, the mans plea had dug into my heart and left me quite pained. I wasn't quite sure what to do with myself as I headed home.  I felt as if I'd made a difference but I couldn't be sure/","One day, I saw a man sitting alone crying on the side of the street. He was homeless and I had found out that he was deathly ill.

3KYQYYSHYWTUK9OIHAPV6ZFRFATDOM,My friend and I grew up together and we spent a lot of time with each other's family. His dad passed away a few months ago from cancer and it was tough on everyone. We always played golf with his dad after school since we were both on the team. His dad was a mentor to myself and someone I looked up to. I never thought we would be playing in a golf tournament together which supports the cancer foundation. We arrived early and bought a memory bag which they set on one of the greens in memory of a loved one. We were team number 8 so we had to wait for the others to start golfing first. We finished 18 holes of golf in a few hours and then met back at the shelter to see the results board. We finished third which was alright with me. It was emotional when we had to receive our award because he gave a short speech about his father. Then we headed over to the local pub and had a few beers to wind down. It was a special moment in my life. My friend appreciated my support and I was more than happy to lend a hand. Next year we plan of getting there early so we can be the first to tee off.

We haven't played the tournament since his fathers death. We decided it would be a good way to honor his life, by playing another tournament this summer. We all got ready to go, and the mood was kind of heavy. When we arrived, my friend seemed very sad. I attempted to lighten the mood by telling everyone a funny story about my friends father. We all shared some laughs and shared some more favorite memory's of his father. We ended up raising a lot of money for the organization. I think this trip helped with my friends grieving a lot.

This all happened around 5 months ago when I got a call from mom telling me that she wanted us to have lunch. I was completely shocked to hear from her. I really didn't want to go, but she seemed dead set on having us meet over lunch. When the day finally came for us to meet, I started remembering all of the emotional abuse that she put me through growing up. I drove to the new Italian place in town that she wanted us to have lunch at. She was already there sitting at a small table outside. We greeted each other as friendly as we both could and we ordered our food. I finally broke the awkward small talk and asked her why she wanted to meet out of the blue. Thats when it happened. She started crying and asking for my forgiveness. While continuing crying, she apologized for all of the things that she did to me. I was starting to get embarrassed as other people were looking over at our table. Awhile ago I had said that I would never forgive her for the constant insults and verbal abuse that she hurled at me over the years. But in that moment, I saw the sincerity and remorse in her eyes.

I would have written about it sooner, but I needed time to process my thoughts about the event, because it was somewhat traumatic.  Now that some time has passed, I think I have enough perspective to talk about it and express how I feel. Three months ago, I wrecked my beautiful truck.  I was coming home from work after the late shift, and it was raining.  I was going down New Road  about 11pm.  I rounded a corner, and there were four deer in the road.  I know right, my greatest fear when driving home at night.  I swerved to miss the deer, which I did successfully, but I went into a spin on the slick wet road.  I slid completely off the roadway and ran into a tree.   Fortunately, I had my seat belt on, because I hit the tree head on.  The airbags deployed and the seat belt did it's job, and I was only shaken up.  The truck was completely totaled and I was so upset about this.  I worked so hard for that truck and I just couldn't believe that God would let this happen to me.   I was upset for weeks.  The insurance did replace the truck, but it just wasn't the same. Now, after several weeks have passed, I realized how ungrateful I was in being upset about the truck.  The important thing is that I walked away completely unhurt.  Not even a scratch.   Trucks you can replace, but I was really fortunate that night. I am going to make a huge effort in the future to be grateful for the important things in life, and care less about the material things.","I crashed my truck on a rainy night after work.

It was an unexpected early promotion as I was not supposed to get promoted until September, instead I got promoted in July. It really came to a surprise to me that I got the promotion so early. I suppose it was because they really enjoy my line of work and love that I am work-driven and know how to complete tasks in a timely fashion and can be consistent and meet deadlines. At least, I hope that is why they decided to give the promotion to me as early as they did. I am very pleased with my work ethic, I enjoy this company a lot and think that I can bring new and fresh ideas to this company as well as be a great manager. I just didn't think that it would happen because even though I work so hard and I want to do a great job and make sure that I am always on time and I am always striving to be a better version of myself from the day before.

So much good has occurred but I have to go back a little ways.  It all began 3 months ago. After several glasses of wine at a girls night, Holly made me go back online to my dating profile and check out my DMs. It was the standard garbage...as in: you are beautiful; want to hang out; how about we meet up and hook up. Ugh! There was also the standard aloof messages that just said ""Hi,"" ""Hello, how are you,"" and things of that general nature. I wasn't really in the head-space to notice one of the guys but Holly immediately noticed someone. His message was fairly normal but seemed a little more genuine, I suppose. Holly and I then checked out his profile and generally stalked as much as we could lol. Then she decided I should reply back to him...I did but almost just so she would stop making such a big deal out of it. Well, much to my surprise, he replied that night and after Holly left I chatted briefly with him as I got ready for bed. Amazingly, I didn't find any of our initial conversation cringy; we just sorta hit it off. Our messages back and forth were honest and it felt intriguing. I went to sleep that night wondering a bit about this new guy but I didn't really have my hopes up - the guard was definitely still up. Anyway, over the next few days we exchanged messages and at some point, I gave him my cell number and we started texting! About 1.5 days into this, he called me and asked me out to dinner --- and soon --- it was going to be the next night; I was nervous but I agreed to meet him. This is where I generally thought things would fall apart as they usually do, but that night we met at a small, quaint, Italian restaurant downtown. We ordered a glass of red and some pasta and what ensued was awesome and blew me away. We talked and talked and just generally enjoyed our food and company. My biggest test - you know the one where I tell the guy that I'm a single mom and I have lupus mostly to see their reaction - well, he didn't even flinch. And instead, he engaged with me about my experiences and was empathetic. That's when I finally realized and believed, this guy is amazing. It had only been a short time but we really hit it off; looking back it almost feels like it was meant to be. I'm so happy to say we are still talking 3 months later...more to come,yay!","After only talking for 2 days after meeting online, I met a guy for dinner.

We prepared for our new lives together. We'd been dating for a long while. We decided to go a step further and finally move in together. This was my first time living with someone.  The emotions were flowing between scared, nervous and excited. These last two weeks have been amazingly liberating and at times, sad. The freedom of being on our own was great. The freedom to be together wherever and whenver we want was the best part. To have every meal together and share our bed.  I can feel our love growing every day.

354P56DE9LPT1SF1XE3IQCFWRCFS74,"I planned my retirement a year in advance after I gave my notice at my place of employment that I was ready to retire. Everyone at work was sad to see me go and I knew it was going to be tough leaving work because I had developed special bonds with many coworkers since I had a couple of decades working there. I thought it was going to be tough spending more time at home than at work and that eventually I would get bored and want to go back to work, so I left my position with the option of coming back if I had ever decided to. As five months have passed since my retirement I never thought I would be enjoying living my life without the pressures of the job I loved doing for so many years. I am truly enjoying every moment of my retirement and I don't plan on doing any work for the time present. I love that I am able to see my granddaughter grow up and give her the time I always wanted to but previously was so busy to do. We have the greatest time together because she such a sweet little girl and I have had the opportunity to care for her four days out of the week while her parents work. I am also able to do that for my daughter so she could go to work knowing that her daughter is in the best hands. I love my life right now and I would not trade it for nothing. I also was able to pick up my old hobby of painting and this all happened just one afternoon when I was cleaning out my attic and I found all of my old paintings. I relived the joy I had as I painted them as an adolescent and I decided I would pick up the hobby once more. It was tough to get back into it but once I had started painting again, I rediscovered why I loved it so much. I am even teaching my granddaughter to paint and she loves it also. It is a great bonding time with her that I would not have had if I had not retired. I truly feel as if I am living my life as I should at this moment and I do not regret my decision to retire as difficult as it was in the beginning since I am so used to be active. I like the moments I am living with my family, I like that I am able to slow down, I like to know that I have the world as my oyster and most importantly I like to know that I am developing so many memories with all of my loved ones.","I retired five months ago and am as happy as I've ever been.

I'm not a very tech savvy person, so it took about two hours to even get anything to display on the screen. By that point, my back was aching so badly and I felt exhausted, but I wanted to surprise my daughter with a little gift. When I brought her to the room, she seemed confused at first, but soon saw her favorite characters from the Secret Life of Pets 2 on the screen and let out a joyful scream. It was a very enjoyable experience! I baked some popcorn on our popcorn machine, picked out my daughters favorite candy, and brought some of her favorite toys to join in to watch the movie. One of her toys, ""Jim Bob,"" a large plush giraffe, sat next to my daughter and she briefly spoke to it whenever something interesting happened in the movie. She ended up loving the movie so much she wanted to watch it again. Now, that movie is extremely long, and while it definitely wasn't my favorite movie in the world, I'm glad that she was able to enjoy it so much. I mostly just sat back and watched as my daughter's smile lit up the room. I'm sure she didn't even know how much the projector cost or how hard it was to find one, but I was happy I was able to make her so happy. Moments like these always make me excited for the future. I wonder if ten years from now she'll want to watch this movie again on the projector and reminiscence about how she talked with her giraffe and tried to make him eat some of her popcorn. I wonder where she will be in ten years, and smile as I think about how she will look all grown up.","I had a really fun childhood and I wanted to share that with my daughter.

It is fascinating how life sometimes pleases us with gifts like this, she in her children always had trouble keeping attention and consent in anything. The professors noticed that their grades were not able to rise since in the classes they did not pay enough attention to understand and at the time of taking the exam I did not know what to do.

I started teaching her at home, I was sending her to do attention exercises and I was looking on Google what I could do to help her. My goal has always been for her to be excellent and I know she will be. At the beginning it was very difficult for him to keep his concentration for a couple of hours, since shortly after starting something he got bored or fixed his attention on something else. It was very stressful to feel that at first nothing worked to help her. I tried everything I found on google, but there was no improvement. It was at that moment when I decided to go to a specialist, and with her we did everything necessary to improve her attention.

3A0EX8ZRN9ADZQU0917ND0PTP07YB3,"I still can't believe my mom is gone. She was such a part of my life for the 24 years that I have been alive. When she passed away two years ago, I had just graduated from college and about to start my professional career. I had just been offered a job in a city on the other side of the country, and decided to move there, even though it meant being away from my friends and family. I know as the youngest of 4 children, this move was going to be hard on my Mom. She had always been so supportive of me throughout my life. She was always there for the good times, and the bad: when I fell off my bike and skinned my knee; when my first girl friend in junior high broke up with me; and when I didn't make it into my first choice for college. Mom was always there to comfort me and reassure me that everything was going to be alright. Mom had raised the four of us since my dad passed away when I was only six, and she devoted her life to us, really. Even though she had a college degree, and could have had a fulfilling career, she sacrificed that to make sure my siblings and I had good, safe home. The day I left for my new job and home, I said goodbye to Mom with tears in my eyes. I told her I would be home at Christmas, and not to worry about me. As always, she gave me a tight hug, and said that I would be successful at whatever I chose to do, and that she would always support me. I really thought I would see her in 4 months, so as I boarded the plane, I wave goodbye, thinking I'll see her soon. She looked to positive and hopeful, my last glimpse of her. It was only two days later, at my new job, that I got the terrible news. Mom had died suddenly from a massive heart attack. Even now, two years later, the day she died haunts me. There were so many things left unsaid to her. I thought I would have time to tell her how much she shaped my life and my character. How much she had sacrificed for me. She was only 60 years old, plenty of time to spend with her, plenty of time to let her know how much I loved her. Mom's sudden passing taught me to never wait to tell the ones you love how much they mean to you, how much you miss them. Time is short.","My mom unexpectedly passed away 2 years ago.

The problem is that the schools are not 5 minutes away from each other; they are more like 15!  This is such a big day for both of them and I cannot wait to see them off to their first days of the rest of their lives. We are all very excited.  My wife and I had to come up with a plan to get each one to school on time, so they didn't feel out of place arriving late. Actually, we wanted them to arrive early to their classes.  So this was the plan. We would all wake up early in the morning and cook breakfast and have a family breakfast together.  It was decided that I would take the oldest son to his first day of kindergarten and see him off, and my wife would take the youngest to Pre-K. That way every one was on time and each child got the specialized attention they deserved. The plan was set, we explained to each of the boys what we were planning and they happily agreed. After breakfast, we each got to say our good byes to the boys and even the boys said goodbye to each other. It was rather emotional for everyone. We loaded our vehicles up and away we went.  As my oldest son and I arrived to the building, I could see the anticipation in his eyes.  He was very excited. As we entered the school, his excitement quickly turned to anxiety. He didn't want to go to the classroom.  I told him everything was going to be okay and I would see him after school.  I said ""Look at the friends you are going to make."" After a few minutes, he calmed down and saw all the other children already playing with the toys.  Out of the window, he could see the playground.

I would go through the motions of going to church, but I found that I didn't connect to it. I do believe that there is a God, but I never knew how involved He was in my life. As far as I was concerned, He wasn't in my life. One day, I had an epiphany.  I was trapped in the middle of the woods after crashing my ATV. Somehow, someway, a flashlight from my ATV fell out, turned on, and pointed in my direction. It allowed someone to find me, and I was able to make a full recovery from my injuries in a few short months. I cannot imagine an event like that taking place in a world without the existence of God.

This all started when Beth started hanging out with the wrong crowd around the time she turned 16. We first felt she was just going through a 'rebellious stage'. We were patient at first and tried to be supportive. The first time we found drugs (marijuana), we were calm with her but told her we never wanted to see these kinds of things in the house again. When we saw her bring boys over, we were firm but caring about the situation. It only got worst. She started hanging out during all her free time with a certain crowd of people, some of them much older than her. Her grades began to slip and we got bad reports from her teachers.

We decided to take a little road trip with them to Indianapolis to visit the children's museum and zoo for the weekend while they were here. The trip wasn't too far and the traffic wasn't bad either, we made pretty good time. The weather was nice for the entirety of the trip, mid 80's and sunny, nothing to complain about. The children's museum was quite interesting and had a ton of interactive things for the kids to mess around with. They looked to be having fun and were running from exhibit to exhibit to see everything the museum had to offer. After they had seen everything there we stopped at the cafe inside to grab some lunch before heading out of the museum and over to the zoo which was conveniently located nearby. The zoo was pretty big so we knew it would take up the remainder of the day, luckily it was only noon so we had plenty of time to see everything. We looked over the map of the zoo to see what we wanted to check out first, the kids wanted to see the large safari animals like the elephants and tigers so that's where we headed first. There was a vehicle you could board that would give you a drive by tour of the animals so we hopped on. We saw elephants, lions, zebras, giraffes and several other animals which the kids liked. They were pointing and trying to take some pictures with their phones. One of the elephants came extremely close to the vehicle and the children couldn't believe what they were seeing. To everyone's surprise, the elephant let out a loud sound that scared everyone, but the tour guide assured us that it was completely normal and to not be afraid. The children were laughing after it happened. After the ride we got off and walked around the rest of the zoo until my cousins' feet began hurting and we decided to call it a day.

So i thought to myself ill give it a shot and maybe throw it up on social media for a few likes. so i wait for a rainy day. fast forward a few days later it starts raining. in my infinite genius i decide to record my foolishness, i may have also had a beer, or three. now its poring down raining and i'm out there shaking it like its going out of style wondering what will hit me first, sobriety or a cold. when the rain stops. a few minutes later i'm just looking up at the cloudy sky just kinda looking stunned when the clouds start swirling. so im just sitting there when i notice the wind start picking up and im just thinking no way. but then it REALLY started picking up and i dashed into my house. the wind lasted a good hour and absolutely wrecked my backyard. when i looked at the news later that today apparently a land hurricane has spontaneously formed over my house. i suppose what im trying to say diary is that ill try to use my newfound superpowers responsibly and that rain dances are no joke.",I learned how to do a reverse rain dance.

Still, whenever we met up, it was like no time at all had passed since we'd last seen each other. We'd laugh and carry on like always. Her presence was always calming. She brightened every day she touched. So, sad as I was, it felt right to speak for her. In my eulogy, I talked about what a good person she was. No matter what was going on, she always saw the bright side. No matter what a person did, she always thought positively. She was relentlessly optimistic. She truly believed in the good in the world.

The way that we ended things the first time was a bit....off, I supposed. You see, I started smoking marijuana when I met this girl. I was about 19 years old, she around 24. I was a Criminal Justice student and pretty straight-laced, unbeknownst to me she was a struggling drug addict that was trying to turn her life around. We started smoking weed together. I like it a lot more now, but back then I wasn't too crazy about it. I just wanted to impress her and seem cool, because at the time I definitely felt like a kid in the relationship. Shortly after I started smoking with her, I started selling as well. She was one of my best and worst customers. I didn't have a lot of money at the time so I couldn't just give her free weed, but I'd sell to her either at my cost or taking a slight loss. I just couldn't keep up with her demand. That girl smoked A LOT. Eventually it got to the point where I had realized she was really just using me for the drugs, and I started to get extremely impatient about the money she owed me (again, keep in mind I was already selling to her at an amazing price because I liked her). Eventually this lead to me banging at her door at 3 A M trying to figure out just where the heck my money was. Her dad answered, and she wasn't too happy about that at all. I made up a BS story about being strung out on crack and wound up getting the money just a few days later. Crazy times. And to think we'd be back together all of these years later...","I reconnected with a girl that I had had an on-off relationship with and we both went to a theme park together for a day.

We spent the day riding some rides together. We had made a deal with each other that she would choose a ride, then I would get to choose a ride and we both would ride them together. We laughed with each other the whole time. It was like old times. It was so good to feel that feeling again that we once shared together. It made we wonder why we both never tried making our relationship last. Throughout the day we grew closer to one another. She began to open up to me and we decided that we try and make it work out again. Now that we both know we want each other in our lives we made a promise that we would both give it our all. We decided to have some lunch, so I took her to the side of the park that had a nice view, laid a blanket down, and told her I would be right back with our food. I went to get our food and stopped by a booth that was selling flowers. I thought she would like it if I surprised her with them.  I was walking back to where she was and surprised her with the flowers. She loved them. We sat and enjoyed our lunch together before leaving the theme park.

We awkwardly looked at each other for a moment trying to figure out if we were correct about each other. It was Jessica, a woman that I had dated years ago until she had to move out of the state for work. We hadn't seen each other since then so it was a shock to find her in my neighborhood. We had a quick conversation in the store and we got caught up on our lives a bit and she said she moved back to help care for her sick father. When I found out she was single I took a chance and invited her out on a date the next night and she agreed. We went to a movie and saw a new romantic comedy that she heard was good and we enjoyed it. Afterwards we stopped at an Italian restaurant and had a great conversation and things felt like she had never left. We went back to my apartment after dinner for a couple of drinks. We got comfortable on the couch and I put on The Boys since she mentioned that she wanted to see it during dinner. We were both asleep before the first episode ended though.

It was a collaborative project, neither of us could have done it alone, but we were also kind of competing. We knew that management was monitoring our progress and that the open Supervisor position would probably go to whichever one of us appeared to be the highest performer. I felt as if I had done really well, contributing most of the labor to the project. However, Ray also did a good job of keeping everything organized. I guess I demonstrated more work ethic, but he demonstrated better project management skills. I say ""I guess"" because here we are, three months later, and Ray is the new supervisor. I'm not really upset, although I am a little disappointed. After working with him on this project I do like and respect him, both as a coworker and as a leader. Obviously I wish I had gotten the promotion instead though. I will probably remember this incident, so I can bring it up at my next performance review. I will ask management if there was something in particular that affected their decision, and if so, are there any suggestions on how I can improve. I will also ask if there are any alternative routes for my advancement, since Ray has taken this open position. Who knows, maybe now that Ray is a Supervisor, he's privy to the behind the scenes action that led to this decision. I think I will ask him about it, and see if he knows why he was picked over me.

It was so nice just to be in his arms again and smell his cologne. The last night I was there was the best. He surprised me with dinner on the beach and the meal did not disappoint. He made fresh seafood pasta with Alfredo sauce, salad, and homemade rolls. We sipped on our favorite craft beer while we set at the little table he had set up.

Staring right to her face, I knew she was lying.  I questioned it, and she just went into a remorse/emotion state and quickly told me the actual reason. She didn't have a cat. The real reason was because she was questioning her sexuality, and the wedding day was just the necessary straw to break the camel's back. It was quite a shocker for us.

When it was time to head out to the game, I almost expected John to be in a nice suit and clean-shaven. I walked downstairs to meet up with him and found that he was wearing his typical fan jersey and he was wagging a huge #1 finger around excitedly.

John told me that he will propose eventually, but I need to let things happen more organically. He wants it to be a surprise, and if I was able to guess it so easily, the experience might not be the same. At first, I was pretty upset and I couldn't figure out what he was talking about but I thought about it a little bit and realized he was right. This wasn't the first time I tried to push the situation, and I guess I was being a little overzealous about getting married.

3R08VXYT7DHM89WAHJDJN1IHXPBW7N,"In a few days, it will be five months since I lost my dream job. This was the job I worked towards my entire career as a chemist. As an investor funded company, I knew it could end at any time, but the company had just received the promise of another two years of funding. Our research was going well and we were meeting deadlines. The day that changed my life started as any other day at work. I was told there would be an impromptu meeting at the end of the day but that wasn't anything out of the norm. Unfortunately, I could not stay for the meeting as my 4 year old had swim practice on Wednesday evenings and I came in early to be able to take her. Everyone in that meeting was told to pack up their desks that evening and not to return. The funding that was promised was not going to happen and they could not afford to keep the staff for one more day. Since I was not at the meeting, I received my news by phone call, while sitting in the parking lot of the local rec center. I was told by HR to return the following day to collect my belongings and that there would be no severance package. It was so devastating of a loss that I could not focus on the task at hand of taking my daughter in for her lesson. The rest of the evening feels like a blur of events. All I can remember is going through the motions to make it to bedtime and getting on my computer to scour job postings. However, the city I live in is far more technology oriented and there were very few science oriented job postings. I started to become depressed and worried about our livelihood. I had only been with the company for a few months and already changed our lives for this job. I switched my daughter's preschool to be closer to my work and it was now a 30 minute commute from our home, with a few months left of the school year. I had also booked a cruise vacation with the extra income this job was providing and felt stressed about making the payments with only one income. The friends I made with my new co-workers were still too new that I didn't have a single one of them on social media. I also wasn't there for the final meeting and that left me without a means of gaining their contact information. I grieved for their loss as well. I knew the hardships a few of my single co-workers were going through and felt lucky that I had my husband to fall back on. This loss was one of the hardest I've encountered but it also brought about such wonderful change. I switched careers to substitute teaching and not being in a lab meant it was safe to have another baby.","The life-changing event of a job loss is never easy.

My mother and brother in law were not close, but the relationship might have been worse than I thought.  I recall my mother talking about doing certain things with my sisters husband when we first heard of the cancer, including going on a long trip together and spending more time together during the holidays.  Her plans with my brother in law gave me the impression that she really wanted to get to know him as a person, and try to relate with him on some level with the time they had left.  I was hoping the soured relationship between my sister and mother would not have interfered wit the plans they had, but that might have been the sole reason for the fall out.	My sister was a rebellious child in her teens, which is where the negative tension between her and my mother started.  This tension carried on throughout their lives, and it all came to a head when my sister married Mark.  My brother in law was a good man, however my mother did not agree with his atheist views, as she had been very religious her entire life.  I feel that my mother resented him for influencing my sisters religious views, which had become non existent over the past few years.  She stopped going to church and stopped showing up for family dinners on the holidays, which was something we did normally at least once a month.  The older you get, the more difficult it becomes to release grudges and judgments towards people.  My mother was open minded to listening what Mark believed in and why he did not believe in god, however those intentions faded as Mark’s situation got worse.  After finding out he had cancer, his attitude towards life began to change, and my mother sensed this.  She decided she did not want to be part of the negativity that surrounded my sisters family at the time, and felt it would have impacted her own religious beliefs.  	I understand why my mother distanced herself from the situation due to her relationship with god, however, life is short and I feel she regrets not visiting my sister and her husband before his death.  My mother put god before her family and has expressed to me she does feel guilty for not visiting Mark, but told me she could not sacrifice her life long commitment to Christianity.  Sometimes in life if we are going to be better people, we have to make sacrifices for others even if they make us feel uncomfortable.",My sister's husband passed of cancer within the last year.

I was grateful for the gift, but passed it off as something I wouldn't do because I don't really believe in psychics or fortune tellers. Three years went by and about three months ago, a friend from my gym was talking about a medium they went to and how much fun it was. I remembered that I had been gifted that session after Hank passed away and got to think about going myself. I scheduled it for the following Friday and was pretty skeptical on what would go on. I figured it would be in a poorly lit room and woman with a bandanna would come out and grab my hand and ask a lot of personal questions then give me a bunch of hokum about the spirit world and lights would flicker and so forth. I figured it would maybe be a fun story to tell at parties. So i get there and this nice young woman, Janice, greets me at the door. We exchange pleasantries and she leads me around the corner to a big red sofa and we both sit down on it and she asks me why I was there, so I told her about my friend Hank, dying three years ago and wondered if he could be contacted. She asked a couple of simple questions about how long ago we met and where then we just began to talk. Not about anything in particular just things. As the conversation went on something amazing happened. Janice grabbed hold of my hand and looked me straight in the eyes and told me about the first time Hank and I met back in high school, and asked if I remembered it. I was dumbfounded. How could she have known that. I told her I did and then she kept talking about things Hank and I did as teenagers and places we went and it was just like talking to Hank. I could not believe it. We started talking about things that he was going through right before he died and how he thought everything would be alright and that he would be watching me to make sure I was not doing anything wrong and things like that. I was amazed at how it all turned out. I thanked Janice and asked her how she does it and she says, she doesn't know, that ""it just happens"". It was incredible. I have recommended Janice to several people over the last three months just to see if they have the same experience I did, and they all have. I called my co-worker back and thanked her for gifting me that session, and I told her how much it meant to me.

3PXX5PX6LYKC38WXTVT7AE7NC95BAZ,"Lifestyle and career are two important, intertwined aspects of everyone's daily lives. A person's career determines their lifestyle both in terms of time and resources available for leisure. Many people also derive a lot of their identity from what they do for work or a career. There are also many industries where a lifestyle may be tied up in a career. For instance, folks that work in the alcohol industry have a pretty specific lifestyle that tends to correspond to their choice of career. Ideally people would be made up of more than just the careers they've chosen but all too often you find folks that seem to have cobbled together an identity based on what they expect people expect of them. In my mind, the most interesting people are folks that have very different careers and lifestyles that sometimes combine in surprising ways. As much as I kind of detest Elizabeth Gilbert, I listened to a talk that she gave about people with different styles of going through life. Some who are incredibly driven and work towards a singular goal but are frankly rather boring. And then there are those that flit from thing to thing and develop a diverse skill set and may not have a huge singular accomplishment but are likely super interesting. There is also a lot to be said for getting out of one's comfort zone. If we only interact with people in a similar career to ourselves, we risk missing out on the upsides of diversity. The same can be said for lifestyle.  If you only hang out with people that have a similar lifestyle, you won't learn much or experience many new things. Especially in cases where a lifestyle is harmful it can be really good to experience folks living in a different way.","life style and career is title for the paragraph I say,In life we are meeting every day too much of type of people and their life stylecareer also the same type",90.0

3EF8EXOTT2HMR3H9L4DVX1XXG62J16,"A few weeks ago I was driving down to visit my parents for the holidays. They live a couple hours away and I was leaving on a Friday night after getting off from work. I had the following week off for Christmas and planned to stay with my family. When I left from work that night, it was almost 8 p.m. and was already dark. My parents live in a secluded area which is pretty dark with a lot of forest around them. It's very beautiful during the day, but reminds me of something out of a horror movie at night. I had my high beams on most of the way since there aren't many cars on the road out there, especially late at night. And since the roads aren't very well lit the high beams help. I was also pretty tired since I left work late that night and wanted to be extra safe. Unfortunately it wasn't safe enough as I hit a deer that night and ran into a ditch. I'm not sure where the deer came from, well actually it probably came from the forests surrounding the roadway. But I never saw it coming. I hit the deer straight on and it smashed my windshield before I flew into the ditch. I remember seeing blood on my windshield before I ran into the ditch, I thought it was mine for the split second that I was still in control of my car. My car was totaled, but I was okay.

3E1QT0TDFQV87SHO271A0A54RBN8I7,"I can relate to this because while I wasn't admistted to a psychiatric ward, I did suffer depression about 25 years ago.  I had just broken up wtih my long-time boyfriend (who I was in a long-distance romance with for the last year of our relationship) and the breaking up was not of my doing. At that point in time, I was prepared to move back to his state (California) and we were to get married.  He decided he no longer wanted that even though he still loved me.  So, here I was, in the Midwest, just having quit my job and thinking, ""now what""?  I fell into a deep depression that was only quashed by some one-on-one therapy sessions (and after that didn't work), a visit to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with clinical depression.  At that time, anti-depressants weren't all that available but I was prescribed one and took it for 6 months.  A horrible situation in my life but I got better and moved on.  Although I moved on, when describing my inner self to a friend, I say that something in me died.  I'm fine; I laugh; I enjoy a good time with friends, but there's a part of me that died with that experience and I have never gotten it to come back to life.

I have never felt anything like the horror that came over me when I realized she was dead--to be honest, I kind of blacked out mentally and don't remember exactly what occurred, but I don't think I'll ever forget how hopeless and terrified I felt in that moment. I looked over to her nightstand and saw a note, she couldn't deal with the pain, the loneliness, it had all become too much for her, but really the details don't matter, do they? The end result is the same, my mom is gone, she took her own life. I felt abandoned, I felt alone, I felt guilty--was I not enough? Was there something I missed? Could anything have gone differently if I had done this or that? We can't change the past, but we sure can feel anxiety about it.

A little over a month ago I received a text from V, who graduated the same year and lived in my dorm. I hadn't spoken to him in roughly two years. You could say it was a shock to see his name pop up on my phone. Interestingly enough, V was getting married and wanted to give me a late invite. Despite feeling a little left out about not getting an invite by mail in advance, I decided to accept anyway. In the end I'm super glad that I did. Tons of old friends were there, and V's new wife ended up being the girl that he started to date right at the end of college. I had met her a few times randomly towards the end of our senior year. The ceremony was packed with tons of people, and they spared no expense. Numerous kegs of expensive beer were purchased, in addition to three chocolate fountains. They even hired one of the best underground DJs in the city to do the music. We danced and partied late in the night. It was also great that V could make plenty of time to talk to me, and I definitely feel like we will stay in closer contact going forward. All in all I had a great time at V's wedding and hope to invite him to mine one day.","My friend V., whom I had not talked to in almost two years, texted me out of the blue.

A man charged into my office with a gun, and started screaming about nonsense while waving the weapon around. I immediately took charge among the terrified employees, and attempted to negotiate with the gunman. I asked why he was doing this, to remain calm and slide me the gun. He was clearly not in his right mind, he was on something, and just kept babbling about random nonsense. I really didn't know what to do. Thankfully, I was able to talk to him long enough to provide ample distraction for the police to come in and apprehend him. Thank god, no one was hurt. We were told that he was indeed high on heroin, and that he definitely wasn't in his right mind. I was thankful that everyone was safe.

Until, that is, four weeks ago, when a most peculiar accident set into motion a series of events that has forever altered my life. I was turning left onto Broadway from Franklin Ave, when this total dill-weed on an electric scooter appeared outta nowhere and ran into my side-view mirror. I rolled down the window and hollered, ""Watch where you're going, you total dill-weed! The street is for cars!"" but she didn't seem to hear me.

I wasn't expecting much, honestly, because we are not rich by any means and usually birthdays are a pretty simple affair.

I was already so surprised, since we don't typically do gifts. He looked so excited giving it to me, I couldn't help but tear into it. Inside I found concert tickets! This was really thrilling because we haven't been out to see anything live in years and I've been dreaming of doing something just like this. What really got me, though, was when I noticed that the tickets were to go see Paul McCartney!

Sometimes I think that Jenn just wants to have the newest and shiniest things to make herself feel better.  A kind of shopping therapy if you would. But I personally don't agree with this mindset. She should focus on long-term goals to feel better. The laptop is really nice though. And if I hadn't recently built myself a PC I would have considered getting one as well. The touchscreen function on it would be great for my digital art. It also has a decent graphics card so would be able to handle some of the games I enjoy playing.

3HWRJOOET6OEA7UBKMHOWM7DCAQES4,"Two months ago, in June, it was my birthday. When I knew that my birthday was approaching, I thought that maybe I just wouldn't try to celebrate it at all. It just wouldn't be the same without mom. Mom would always plan the family events, and it would be too hard without her there. But then my aunt reached out to me and suggested we still have a party. It made me feel special and made me think, it would be good to get the family together. Maybe it would help us each heal a little faster, having each other there for support. My family could see how much I was struggling, as they were, but they also helped me out financially and that made me feel really loved. When we had the party, I cried the morning of it. But then when everyone showed up, I felt great. I was relieved that I had family around. We ate cake and food and they sang to me. I opened up some nice presents, and one of them was a photo album with a lot of photos of all of us family members with my mom. We all cried together, but they were happy cries. Not all memories have to be sad, they can make us happy too! I will always remember mom fondly and be sure to spend even more time with the rest of my family, because we can all help each other out. I am so blessed!","My birthday celebration in June was the beginning of healing for my family. Since my mother's death, I have leaned on my extended family more for support.

Most of his meals have come from a plastic package or a drive-thru, with a giant soda to wash it down. I tried not to judge him for it, but over the years I noticed he had started to gain more and more weight. He just didn't seem to care. I mean, I love to indulge at times, but it got to the point where, if we got pizza, he would have three or four slices for every slice I had, to the point where we had to get him his own extra large pizza every time. Well maybe I was too gentle, but I was never able to talk sense into him. Until one day he was feeling so dizzy at work that he fell over and had to leave early. It turns out, he went to the doctor and had to get some tests ordered, and he has diabetes. Type 2 diabetes. His doctor told him that the only thing he can do about it is change his diet completely. He has to avoid carbs now; if he doesn't, he will have some serious health problems. Now maybe this is a weird way of looking at it, but I see it as a wake-up call for both of us. I wasn't able to help him before, and now he's sick. But it's not too late for us to do something together. We've been learning to cook healthy meals together, which has been a lot of fun for both of us. It's something we never knew we might like to do together.

As I mentioned in previous entries, my sister moved out of the country to take a position for a new company. This was a big deal for her, as it was something that she wanted to do, and was excited about. A little over a year ago, she started to feel ill, so she want to the doctor. After doing some medical examinations, it came back that she was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. The doctor recommended exploratory surgery. About 4 months ago, they proceeded with the exploratory surgery, and discovered that is was less serious than they originally believed (which is a relief). The bad news is that they cannot safely remove the entire tumor. I spoke with my sister on the phone just now, and she is in good spirits. I have always known her to be optomistic about life in general, and I know that she can pull through. Even still it is scary to think about her mortality, and also the fact that I may not see her again.

He's definitely going to go get one now. It's not quite worth as much as I paid for it, because I think it's a bit of a dad and I'll probably get tired of it soon. I mean, it's great for watching movies! Fun for video games too. Other than that, I can't believe I purchased it. I'm getting buyer's remorse thinking about it. I did get it on sale though. Now I'm trying to justify spending the money. I bought it 2 month s ago, so I can't take it back now.

After a one hour orientation, where they showed me the grounds and pens,  and a video about how to interact with the dogs, I was given a dog to walk around the lakeside. It was an easy enough task, and the dog, named Betty, was eager, happy, and easy to handle. I had no trouble, until a group of volunteers coming from the opposite direction with their dogs attempted passed us. All the dogs started to bark and pull at their leashes. A few started to fight, and it caused some of the volunteers to panic. Eventually, we all gained control and finished the walk without further problems. I returned Betty to her pen after the walk, then went to ask what else I could do. I was given the task of washing up the linens, beddings and toys in the laundry room. After that, I did the dog and cat dishes (yes, they have cats, too.) I was there only four hours, but it  felt longer because this is, after all, Florida, and boy is it hot! I signed up for most Sundays to volunteer over the summer. It feels good to help with such a good cause! Also, it is alot of fun to work with dogs, who really appreciate your company.

My doctor initially told me it would be a good idea to help ease my symptoms, but I'm starting to really enjoy being out and about. About three months ago I was especially restless one morning and opted to take myself out for a day of fun. I hit the local mall and walked all through my favorite stores. I probably spent a full hour in Macy's alone. I bought a pair of new sandals and a really cute beach hat too, which are things that coincidentally help reinforce this new lifestyle I'm trying out. After shopping I stopped into a new restaurant that opened near the mall. It felt odd to eat by myself, but after a few minutes I really started to enjoy it. I almost felt like some important business person. My steak was perfectly cooked and I even had a margarita to drink. By this point I really started to feel my legs getting achy, and the 100 degree temperatures outside didn't exactly help things too much. Against my better judgement I ended up deciding to see a movie to cool down, but found myself frustrated when I realized the theater's air conditioning was turned off. Who turns off AC in 100 degree heat?!? I ended up finishing the movie, but my legs were not in great shape and I was feeling quite dehydrated. After sitting on a bench for a bit to gather my thoughts, I determined that I should not try to get home in this shape. Thankfully my good friend Judith answered her phone and was willing to come get me and take me home. I apologized to her for overextending myself on this day, but I think she understood how much I enjoyed my independence.

It took a couple days to get here and I was really worried that I was just wasting my time and money. Still my curiosity got the best of me and I decided to try it. It tasted awful, like seriously, the worst thing I have ever purposely drank. At first I really didn't see anything happening, other than excessive use of the bathroom. But after two or three days and around ten pound of bad stuff being removed from my body I began to believe it was actually working. It worked really well for like two weeks, and then it wasn't really doing anything anymore. This kind of disappointed me but I was determined to keep going, and keep getting my body healthier. So a month ago I started a different way, I started getting more sun, and eating more raw foods. I went on walks, and just tried to let my body detoxify as naturally as possible.

It was then that a light bulb seemed to go off in both of our heads. Our other friend ended up leaving early so we just chatted all night and eventually went home together. We hit it off perfectly. We have always had great chemistry together and shared many interests, so it made sense. We also appeared to be very much attracted to each other.

So days and days went by until I took on the task of inquiring if she really had used that for her mortgage, the truth was that no, I spend it on something I still don't know.

It was now early afternoon, so we decided to grab a late lunch and decide what to do with the rest of the day. There was a cool-looking bar and restaurant right on the beach, so we walked down there and got a table. It was the tail-end of lunchtime, so the place wasn't too busy and we didn't have to wait for our table. Our waiter was pleasant and knowledgeable, and we ordered a couple different seafood dishes. I recall that I ordered fish tacos, Hope ordered a shrimp cocktail, and Mom and Dad ordered something different from either of us so we could share.

He told us they had been ordered by someone who had then left in a hurry and he was going to throw them out unless we wanted them. They were typical ""resort"" looking drinks, with umbrellas and fruit, and we gladly accepted them. About ten minutes after this, I began feeling a little queasy.

The doctor claimed it was some kind of back injury and prescribed Pips some pain meds and suggested some weird exercises and stretches to do with her. I was told that the I would be called for a follow up soon.  It's been 4 weeks and no calls or answers from the doctor. Pips has lost weight and the pain meds have ran out. I tried the exercises and Pips howls out in pain! We can't sleep and I cannot bare to see Pips in pain anymore! I have to carry her everywhere and I have already missed too many days at work! I am currently looking for another vet I can trust. If I don't, I have no clue what will happen to Pips. I just want her to be okay so I can have my silly, hyper puppy back.","This is about a day that seemed to be a normal visit to my vets office for a limp, that turned into a 2month long nightmare.

They happily tapped the tops of their heads to make them bounce as we found our seats.  My daughter was a bit bored after the first few innings.  She did get very interested as the mascot made its way over to our section though.  His bright yellow fur made her eyes dazzle.  We got a nice picture of our kids with the mascot together.  After the game ended, which was quite close in score, the after show began.  Fireworks blasted bright in the sky.  They scared my daughter a little, but she was happy to see them end.

She was the kind of person that was a bit reserved, but we convinced her to have the party after a bit of prodding and promising not the go too far (*fingers crossed*). The setting for the party was a hotel in a nearby town, and about 20 people were there to celebrate. As soon as the person of the night came, the drink were being slung, and the party was jamming. It was about 70 minutes into the party that things started to get a bit crazy. One of our friends saw when she came into the hotel that a buggy was parked in the parking lot of the hotel. We all thought it would be fun to leave the hotel room and to drive around town enjoying the starry night sky.  We didn't have a care in the world at that point, and the bride-to-be was completely into the whole thing. I'd never seen her as into something as she was at that moment sitting next to me in that buggy driving through town in the dead of night.

They saw how tipsy we were and probably thought we were an easy lay. Alcohol and cautious thinking don't mix, so a few of our friends who were very drunk decided to go with the guys to party before heading home. It  wasn't until the next morning that we heard what happened. Apparently, they woke up feeling like they were given something other than alcohol.

I was pretty amazed that someone could be so belligerent over a meaningless regular season NBA game, so I was speechless for a moment. Then I asked the man what his problem was and why he was so upset at the game. He told my friend and I that were just bandwagon fans, and only liked the Lakers because they traded for Anthony Davis. I told him that he was clearly drunk and should just shut up and go home. To my surprise, he actually did leave without saying much else after that. His outburst really ruined the night, though, and it made me forget that we were supposed to be celebrating my friend's birthday.

Firstly, it took an incredibly long amount of time and too much energy. I don't think it needed to be as stressful as it was. It was strenuous and tiring, all for a job that is supposed to be relatively simple. My trainers were not trained in the subject matter themselves and have never worked in this position. Because of that, they had a hard time going over the subject matter with us as a class and it was painful to witness them struggle. I regret the entire experience, as I was offered a better position some weeks later with a better pay amount and less stressful training. It took SO LONG to complete, every training class was 3 hours long and we did several classes a day. The organizers were incompetent, and this was a mistake by far.

I have memories of her when I was young coming to all of my school events, and cheering me on at sports events. She talked me through hard times with friends and boyfriends as I got older. She also encouraged me to work hard in school which I did. Due to her encouragement, I got into college and she paid for everything. I did really well in college, and immediately got a job I love right after graduation. I feel really sad because I am not married yet, and always dreamed that she would meet my future husband and children. I am still in shock that she died so quickly because I always viewed her as a healthy person. She went to all of her physicals, and it seemed like her cancer came out of nowhere. I have no idea how her cancer wasn't caught through routine blood work that she had at  her last physical. I feel angry, but those feelings of anger are now being replaced by feelings of sadness.",My grand-mother passed away on October 14th. This wonderful women raised me since I was a baby and I feel so lost without her.

The knuckles of her right hand, however, are white with rage as she clutches her camera. She knows that in a matter of moments, the doors to the sanctuary will be flung open and the first notes of the processional will fill the air. Guests will rise and, as if in unison, arms holding camera phones will extend into the aisle. Those not sitting on the coveted aisle seat will raise their phone or tablet into the air. Not just family and friends, but co-workers and “plus-ones” — people with no vested interest in the bride cramming to get a photograph. Yes, she knows that in a few seconds, the church will be filled with Camera Phone paparazzi, rending her official task impossible. She grips the camera tighter and continues to breathe deep breaths. And then…she sees it. A selfie stick. She isn’t sure to whom it belongs, but it doesn’t matter. It is there, extended midway into the aisle. A Sword of Narcissism extending from the hands of a disrespectful guest. And something deep within her snaps. She gently places her camera on the floor behind her and begins walking down the aisle. She finds she no longer has control over her legs; they refuse to stop. She thinks, for a moment, if this is how it feels to be possessed. An almost out of body experience. She watches with fascination as a hand she recognizes as her own reaches out and yanks the selfie stick from its surprised owner. She grasps it with both hands and holds it high above her head, much the same way one would when presenting an item of tribute. And then, in one swift move, she raises her knee and brings the selfie stick down, breaking it in two. With a deep sigh of satisfaction, she hands both pieces back to the startled owner and makes her way triumphantly to her position at the front of the church. She will never photograph another wedding after this. Rumors of her instability will spread far and wide.

The procession started with my friend, the groom, and his parents. He looked amazing in a navy blue tuxedo with a light pink tie. It was very classy. After the bridesmaids and groomsmen walked down the aisle, it was time for the bride and her father to enter. Everyone stood up and turned their heads as the bride walked into the hall. She was absolutely beautiful; stunning from head to toe. Her dress was barely touching the ground, yet her veil had a four foot train behind her. The whole ceremony only lasted about twenty minutes, and was well officiated by one of our close friends. After that, the wedding party headed to the banquet hall next door for a few drinks and appetizers. Luckily, it was open bar so I didn't have to pay for a glass of wine. An hour or so later, everyone settled into their seats as the DJ announced the new couple. They had their first dance, as well as the mother-son and father-daughter dances. Dinner came out shortly after the best man and maid of honor made their speeches. I ordered the steak, and it was cooked to perfection. After I ate, I had a couple more cocktails and that's when the real fun began. We danced for a few hours, and celebrated the new couples nuptials.

Martial Arts was never something I saw myself pursuing professionally. My father owned a dojo, and as a child, I would spend a majority of my weekends training with him. I thought it was a mere hobby to me, more than anything, but my father had always told me that I had the talents to go further. I didn't take his advice, though. The amount of time I spent training, dwindled when I graduated high school and entered college. About a year ago, a friend of mine happened to stumble upon an ad on Facebook about the tournament and brought it to my attention. At that moment, I heard my father's words echo in the back of my head, and I decided to give it a shot! I trained hard for months. It was both the most difficult and rewarding period of my life. There were times where I was on the brink of giving up and dropping out of the tournament completely. At other times, I felt on top of the world and extremely confident. On the days leading up to my first match, I was very nervous. You have no idea how happy I was when I won. Hard work really does pay off! The entire experience was euphoric for me, and I realized that instead of a hobby, Jiu Jitsu, may have been a forgotten passion for me!",I trained hard for a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu tournament.

I worked so hard training for this tournament and my hard work paid off.  I was so happy after winning and has motivated me to keep training in Jiu Jitsu.

I know that I will have to train harder than ever so I can keep winning matches.

I also want to get my diet in check so my body will be in tip top shape for competing. I still can't get over the fact that I won!!

I have been involved with the church choir music for many years but knowing my peers though highly enough of me to choose me to lead it was really humbling.  I really worked so hard at preparing the music selections.  I tried to think of the events of the month and things that were going to be spoken about in the service.  I wanted songs everyone could relate to as well.  These were known songs and everyone there really seemed to enjoy it.  I met with the pastor as well as the other church members and reviewed the selections with him which he had no problem approving.  This suprised me as I thought I would have to tweak a few of them. They stated the selections were perfect and everything flowed well.  I felt so nervous that day but once I got there and saw my peers familiar faces I calmed down.  I took a deep breath and began the compositions.  The next thing I knew it was over. The event was over in a flash - its funny how things happen like that when you immerse yourself in something.

We arranged the funeral and it was a beautiful ceremony, but it was an awful experience. Not only did I have to deal with the fact that he is gone, I also had to deal with my dad's shoveling of causes. After the funeral, something happened that caused people to leave said funeral in disgust and disdain. I had no idea what happened at first. My grandmother, who suffered quite a bit as a result of her husband passing, was approached by my father. I was being consoled for feeling like I was, but that didn't change the fact that my dad did this. He approached my grandmother, for what I thought was condolences. That would have been well and fine. Unfortunately, that wasn't what happened. I found out that my father took advantage of the fact that grandma was alone and away from people. He tried to convince her to join GLAD, and didn't even bother to feel the room out.

386CSBG1O08YKCMJM09LPY0Z6VU6Q6,"When we crossed the water for the first time over a giant sequoia bridge in Clearwater, FL, I saw a decent fish just sitting in an eddy of the rock-strewn bottom. I got excited because that meant there might be decent fishing. We finish our hike (looping back to this bridge again) by mid afternoon. I get my stuff out and rigged up and start tossing bugs. Every offering, this fish beneath the bridge would short strike but never take. I switched to an ant and had my son grab it and let go. I figured it was time to let him cool down because I thought I could catch him on that pattern, but he had seen it too much to take it at that point. I went downstream, fishing the seams and holes I could find. As I walked downstream surrounded by these sequoias 40 feet around, I came to this pool at the end of a run. It looked fishy. You know what feeling when you're fishing new water but you get to a spot and laugh to yourself that if there's no fish in there you might as well pack it up now? It was that king of spot. I toss out my ant pattern from before, right at the bottom of the run before it opens up into a slow slow drift over a hole that was at least three times deeper than any hole I had seen up to that point. I look down to manage my line and prepare for a couple of mends to get that fly to drift perfectly through that hole. When I looked up I saw the silhouette of what would be considered Jaws in this tiny stream. He was nearly at my fly and then he pounded that thing. Not some measly sip. This big boy knew how to eat. I got a great hookset and it was game on. Within the first ten seconds this fish had launched itself two full body-lengths out of the water three times. It was an absolute rocket. It had all the room in the world to swim down because the pool was so deep, and then launch itself straight out of the water like it was straight out of Cape Canaveral. My son had assisted me by pulling the fish out of water, we had both fell back and on the dock. After we finished fishing, we went back home where my wife made dinner and my son was just smiling because he had a great time.","Took my son fishing for the first time in his life.

You know, that moment that you'll be able to look back on and still remember ever little detail, because it just means that much to you? I was lucky enough to be able to experience that with Cash a few months ago. A few girlfriends and I had planned a last minute trip to Clearwater for a girls weekend. Somehow both Lydia's kids and Stacey's kids came down with this god awful stomach bug, so I asked Cash if he wanted to go instead. Spa days aren't exactly a five year old's idea of a grand time, so I knew I had to come up with something that both Cash and I would enjoy. On the flight to Clearwater, we discussed what we wanted to do and decided that fishing would be such an awesome experience for both of us. I grew up fishing, but Cash hadn't gone yet, since his dad wasn't exactly the outdoorsy type.  After a quick Google search and car rental, we were off to the pier to get our fishing permits and gear. When we got to the marina, I paid for the permits and sent Cash to the coolers to look at the bait. I just knew that the live worms and other bait were going to give him quite the shock. The little squeal he let out when he realized the bait was alive gave me a good laugh. After I paid the cashier, I collected our fishing rods and grabbed Cash's hand. It was time to show Cash the joys of fishing. We sat our stuff on the bench near the edge of the dock and I showed him how to bait his hook, and then we did some practice casts. After we both felt confident that he had grasped the concept, I told him to cast off the pier and get ready to do a lot of waiting. I swear, no sooner than his lure hit the water, he had a bite. He squealed with joy as he started reeling in his line. When he finally got the fish on the dock, I helped him remove the hook and toss the fish in the bucket, and repeated the process again. Cash caught a total of twelve fish in the three hours we were there, meanwhile I only caught a measly two. My pride was a little hurt that my five year old just showed me up at fishing, something that I grew up doing, but I could not have been more proud. I think I might have passed on my love for fishing to Cash and that is totally worth it.","Took my son fishing for the first time in his life.

My boyfriend's grandmother passed away, and while we weren't technically family, she definitely felt like a family member to me.  She had always been so sweet and welcoming to me and I felt very close to her.  When she had to go into the nursing home after her knee replacement surgery, it wasn't that big of a deal because it was only for rehabilitation, so it wasn't like she was giving up her independence.  She was going to be back in her own home in about 6 weeks.  But she never went home.  During orthopedic rehab she fell and injured her other leg.  Of course everyone in her family was upset and so was I, but we still didn't think that it was a life threatening injury.  Then, after she was transferred back to the hospital, she developed a blood clot in the leg, it shot to her lungs and she was gone overnight.  My reaction was shock, I could hardly believe it could happen like that.  At first my boyfriend and the rest of the family seemed to be reacting the same way, in other words in an appropriate way.

It's made me question my perspective on everything from my self concept to my understanding of love and the impermanence of life. Mom had a rare form of cancer that was hard to diagnose and radically aggressive. We only found out about it when she had a body MRI and the tumor was discovered in her kidney. She was given three months to live and a very high certainty of mortality in that time frame, no matter the treatment. Mom's a fighter, so she decided to live those three months as honestly and fully as possible. She moved in with us so she could spend more time with my wife, my daughter and I. It was controversial but she decided against chemo or other treatment so she could enjoy her time. In the first month we traveled to Kauai and Peru, two places she had always wanted to go, but most importantly we walked to daycare to drop off my daughter after laughing through breakfast, watched crappy gameshows and silly movies, and played games. By month two she had lost her ability to really move around, and 60 days later, she passed in her sleep. The honest and tender moments we spent together in her last days have shown me the most important words in life are, ""I love you."" I will never forget the time we spent together. My daughter will always have cherished memories of grandma, her last picture taken was at Pfeiffer park in Big Sur, snuggling with her. Sometimes life puts crises in your path to learn a hard lesson.

3G5F9DBFOQJ6M92H4IUZSCOX3VOHV6,I have been staying in my home for about four years now. I haven't had much problems in the years I have been here. Except a year ago when about 6-7 new families had came to live on the same street in which I have been staying. At first it wasn't much issues having that there was a decent amount of new people moved in the neighborhood. Eventually things started to brew and a there were potential issues coming along that could make the neighborhood better or worse. It was a situation in which if people came together to find a solution things could work out. That being said I wanted to get most of the new neighbors involved. It was a talll task to begin with but things clicked. Myself and couple neighbors I am close with were able to gather everyone. New neighbors change the tenor of a street. This was a usual quiet neighborhood but things did get a little more loud due to this issue. Our neighborhood had rallied against this potential threat. Everyone had built a bond in which we felt connected to each other. Maybe due to everyone being able to come together and figure a problem out. I feel even more welcome and accepted.,New neighbors change the tenor of a street. A quiet neighborhood rallies against a potential threat. I feel even more welcome and accepted.,90.0

I am having a difficult time writing this because I felt as if Dad and I were starting to get close again after such a long time apart.  Until Dad's cancer, I hadn't seen or talked to him in over 10 years.  The bitterness that I held inside was very taxing on me and I'm sure on him as well.

Through prayer and guidance, I have been able to get past these feelings and realize that I can't put every man in the same category.  After Dad was diagnosed with Cancer, he asked to see me and we talked many times and began to heal our relationship.

I did not plan ahead and did not think of an alternative route to cycle through, so I had no choice but to go past them. They partook in a match of paintball. As they were playing, I got hit in the shoulder by one of the paintball capsules. I was super mad at the children, and was tempted to yell at them. I just wanted to get home above all, though, so instead of adding to the conflict I instead made sure to bike much faster until I knew for sure I was completely out of the kids sights.

She recommended the local cafe that we used to go to for lunch all of the time before she left. Best of all? This was going to be a girl's day, just the two of us, NO BOYFRIEND ALLOWED.

There are a lot of agents out there who are not great with computers, and smaller offices probably have very little IT security. On top of that, realtors have their email addresses right out there on their websites. So scammers send a phishing link to the realtor asking them to update or confirm their email and password. If the realtor falls for it, then the scammer just logs in and watches the email to find someone about to close on a house. They probably even have a copy of the purchase and sale agreement. Some scammers will actually send the message from the realtor's actual email address asking you to wire money to the scammers account, then they delete the email from the sent folder.

He took me on a date 3 months ago and that was sweet. We talked about our families, and I got to talk about my girls. He seemed very friendly and open to a family with kids. At one point, he got excited about a story he was telling that he spilled his water all over the table.  It soaked the linen and dripped down onto my lap. We had to call the waitress over to clean up the mess. He was super embarrassed and turned bright red. In a way it was cute. In another way, I had a wet dress. I appreciated him taking me to an italian restaurant, since I am such a picky eater. What I really miss is how simple things were with Dave, though.

He told me that he was going to drop out of our high school and travel the world with his father's trust fund money. He said that he was looking forward to traveling to various exotic places, such as Bali and Bora Bora. I lamented the fact that I would likely never see him again, because I had just won a full-ride scholarship to Stanford University and would be in California for the next four years of my life. When Rachel found out about my scholarship, she spread a fake rumor around our high school that I had cheated my way into Stanford. I could not believe her audacity at snubbing me. I will keep holding a grudge against her. I look forward to the day that I can sabotage her career. I told my best friend Paulina the good news about my scholarship, but instead of being happy for me, she started crying. I reckon this is because she also applied for the scholarship but got rejected instead. We haven't talked since then, and I am conflicted between whether I should end our friendship or reach out to her first and make up. If we were to make up, the first thing I would do is bake her some cupcakes, because that is her favorite type of dessert. I would have to bake the cupcakes by myself, because I have no significant other to bake them with. Now that Richard is leaving forever, I  need to find a new secret crush so I do not have to do so many things by myself. What do you think, diary? Should I bake the cupcakes or let our friendship come to an end? Friends are harder to come by, the older I get. Sincerely, A confused girl",I bumped into my secret crush.

I had bailed her out a couple of times before but I kept telling her that she needs to learn to take care of her business.  She didn't learn apparently.  She asked me if I could loan her $2500.  I told her that I was strapped for cash at the moment and couldn't help her out.  She gut upset with me and we had a fight.  I told her that she needs to grow up and manage her finances instead of spending them frivolously.  She ended up getting out of the situation.

I haven't got to talk about what officially it is now so I guess I'll just start with being invited to dinner by my boss. I don't go to the steakhouse we went to very often, heck I'm gonna be honest, I was freaking about going in general. I love the idea of having a good top sirloin, but on my intern salary that's not really a thing. I would never say no to a boss though and eating dinner went good. I mean, actually better than good, pretty great. We talked about maybe starting full time at the desk position I've been dropping hints about all year. Like actually have a start date to train and everything. I went and sat at the bar afterwards to celebrate when the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my life sat next to me. Needed me to pretend to be her cousin Jim because some sleeze ball wouldn't leave her alone. Ended up talking and her name was Vanessa. Talked about any and everything honestly. What she thinks of politics ( I like to get that out of the way ahead of time), what her view is on whiskey, how she likes her eggs cooked. I'm gonna be honest, that's a big thing for me because runny eggs are awful. Anyway, we've been talking this whole time off and on. Random text messages, like the one I got rubbing in mu face that the Patriots finally lost. I had told her I thought Brady would do one more superbowl before retiring, but I guess hindsight is 20/20. I finally asked her to be my girlfriend that day so I guess you could say the Pats won something for me lol. I now have an amazing girlfriend, a start to a dream job, and an excitement for the future.

My husband was running late and texted me that he would be there in about ten minutes. We waited for a while, listening to the radio in the car, and everything was fine for about seven or eight minutes. Then I heard a loud engine in the distance. My son heard it too, and commented on it. After a while the noise grew louder and eventually the car was close enough that I could see it coming. The car was speeding and veering around, so I quickly realized the driver was drunk. My son and I sat in silence, hoping that this reckless driver would pass by without causing any problems for us. Unfortunately that was not the case. Just as the car was passing us, it started spinning wildly. This happened so suddenly that neither of us had time to react. I had parked the car next to a light pole because I thought it would make it easier for my husband to find us in a bright spot. That light pole may have saved our lives, because the spinning car hit the pole and stopped instead of hitting our car. My son and I were both so shocked that we didn't say anything for a while. Eventually we got out of the car to check on the driver, who also got lucky and only had a few minor injuries. My husband arrived just as this was happening, and ran to the scene of the accident.

He was the only brother so was especially cherished by his 4 older sisters. He was studious, giving, caring and tried to do the right thing at all times. He volunteered at the homeless shelter in his college town. He attended mass every week. He took time to keep in touch with out parents and with all of our sisters. My family is devastated. This is our first loss in our family and none of us are quite sure how to deal with the hurt. We are close, all live in the same town and have each other but that doesn't seem to assuage any of the hurt or loss in our hearts. My mother has turned to the church, talking to our priest, praying and attending functions. My father has turned inward, trying to heal himself. My sisters and I have tried to help our parents but as we are suffering as well it has been a botched job at best. My sisters and I can help each other though, lending a sympathetic ear at least. We are still muddling through this and I don't know that my family will ever completely get over the loss of our baby brother. My little brother was an avid outdoors person who loved to hike, canoe and camp. Because of this my sisters and I are thinking of creating a sort of memorial along one of his favorite hiking trails in our town. The trail has a program where you can plant a tree and/or pay for a bench along the trail which helps fund the trail. I want to do both, plant a tree which will shade the bench as it grows, with a plaque showing it was donated in my brother's name. I think this would be a wonderful way to memorialize my little brother as he loved being outside hiking while always having his old Pentax film camera along with him. As I write this I find I have made the decision, I will do this for sure, plant a tree for my brother and provide a place for weary hikers to sit in memorial to him.","I wrote about my brother who died 3 months ago and gave a few detail about him , myself, and my family.",90.0

Today my big brother would be starting his senior year or high school and I my freshman year. Earlier this year he was involved in a car accident after his junior prom. Why do people drink and drive? I should be getting my drivers permit pretty soon but my parents aren't exactly thrilled for me to be driving soon. I can understand, it has been a traumatizing experience for me as well. But I know they could use the help with running errands and taking my little sister to school. My brother was always so helpful, he was like superman. Captain of the basketball team, on the honor roll, popular and still made time to help us with homework and getting where we needed to be when mom and dad were working long hours. Ever since he died things have been quiet at home. We try not to being him up much and when we do, we smile and then immediately get saddened that we can't hear just one more joke. He and a few friends had been involved in an accident with a drunk driver who is now in prison, this wasn't his first DUI but we are praying it is his last. I hope they put him away for a long time. My brother's life wasn't the only one that was lost that night. Two other individuals from his basketball team were in the car with him, twins to a single mom who lives just down the street. I see her from time to time when I ride my bike around the neighborhood. She looks sad, lonely. I know just the feeling. My brother was the only one who didn't make me feel invisible.

I miss the professors who used to bestow their knowledge unto me weekly as well as the different people I'd run into at any given time. I miss learning about various topics and broadening my horizons. One thing that I really found out though is that I really do enjoy learning about different cultures. My professors were from many different cultures and I had many of them who wouldn't mind sharing their stories with the class.  Not only that, but people from different backgrounds as well, such as poor, middle class, and rich. I really do miss many of my colleagues, who really were different from me in terms of backgrounds, race, some even from different countries. One thing I really liked about them was that If you ever had a question to ask about their culture, they wouldn't mind sharing , as long as you were respectful about it. My best friend in University was Asian and he's told me many stories about where he was from, and the thing's he used to do while there.  I would also share the same about where I'm from and my experiences from living in America.  We were truly like-minded in that way. I think these experiences will stick with me forever, as it isn't often that you get a chance to get out of your comfort zone the way University provides.

3D3VGR7TA11ZZUE1GD0NNLYKTW3R38,"The most devastating thing I've ever experienced happened to me about 10 months ago and I'm nowhere near over it yet.  I had been involved in an online forum for video games, which I love, and started communicating to a few people regularly.  One of them was a girl around my same age who seemed to have similar tastes in games and other things.  We started chatting more and more and eventually it seemed like things were developing into romantic interest.  I've never been really good at that type of thing, so I was reluctant to pursue it in any way.  Besides, emotional connections are easy to elicit online.  Feeling ""warm and fuzzies"" about someone online, just based on their writing and the created image you have of them, isn't the basis of real love or connection.  It's very artificial.  Nonetheless, after spending more and more time online with her, sometimes hours per day, Skyping, texting, and communicating every way possible, even I was thinking we both had real feelings for each other.  I mustered up all my courage and expressed my feelings for her and she said she felt the same way.  I was relieved, ecstatic, and panicked all at the same time.  After getting over the initial shock and relief, I started thinking about how to proceed.  Eventually I convinced her to let me come see her in Sweden, where she was from.  She was amenable to the idea although never jubilant about it, which, in hindsight, I should have taken as a warning sign.  Instead, I plowed ahead, full speed, blinded by my feelings and excitement.  To make a long story short, she was supposed to meet me at the airport.  But she wasn't there.  I texted her and got no reply; I phoned her and got no answer.  At that point I was panicking a little, thinking something had happened to her, not realizing that the disaster was happening to me.  I ended up actually getting a hotel room because I didn't know what else to do.  I actually didn't even know where she lived at the time.  But when I got to my hotel room, after a few days, I started to get angry instead of worried.  So I put on my internet detective hat and searched the internet to find out her address.  I went to her place and camped out, waiting to see if she'd show up.  At that point I saw her coming out of an apartment, being playful and hugging a guy who was clearly her boyfriend, and she was pregnant--I absolutely broke down at that point, flew home, and never talked to her again.","Going to another country for the first time to meet the love of my life.

We also have two young children, so the added stress of spending time with them while trying to spend time together was a lot to deal with as a young, newly-wed couple.

Nursing care is not offered, nor does this kind of facility have legal authority to give skilled nursing care. If a nurse is on staff, the nurse's role is limited to assessment and directing the resident assistants. Some assisted living facilities also have a separate nursing home wing or section, and that requires a different license to be a skilled nursing facility. If there is an emergency, no one will not offer emergency care. It is difficult to care for, or needs frequent treatment for chronic conditions, the assisted living facility may not accept them. A doctor has to verify that they are suitable by signing a form. On top of that, the facility does its own assessment to see if the prospective resident is a fit for their community. No one is watching over your loved one 24/7. Help is available, but your aging parent will not have a personal attendant noting their every move. Someone will check on them daily and if they don't show up for meals, someone will notice. If medications are being given out by the attendant (""med tech"") every day or more than once a day, that person will notice if something is wrong. They help with basics but should not be expected to diagnose, or offer anything other than exactly the medications on the resident's list. They may ask the nurse to check on a resident. These homes offer an enriched social environment. There are meals in common and a chance to socialize, activities offered, and entertainment of various kinds. Some communities offer classes. Residents have a way to call someone if there is a problem. If they're not feeling well, an assistant can be summoned by either pulling a cord, a call bell, or pressing a button. The proximity of attention to an aging parent's needs is one of the best ways to assuage the worries of adult children. The actual cost of assisted living may not be fully understood when you size up a place under consideration. You may be quoted the price for the rent of the apartment. The cost is usually more than the rent, as your loved one must also pay many other charges.

I've been dating a new guy for a few weeks, and I really wanted him to have a chance to meet her since she is so important in my life. We decided to go out for dinner last week, and things could not have gone better. I wasn't really nervous about introducing them because many of our friends say we're like two peas in a pod. I knew he would adore her as much as I do. At dinner, he was very charming and polite to her. He made sure to show his humorous side, which helped her get comfortable. They laughed and joked a lot, and we had a very good time. I think the best part of the night was after dinner. We decided to go to her house to drink some coffee.

Normally one of them is usually home with the kids, but because work required them both to be gone for almost 12 hours a day, I agreed to help them out. I have babysat before for them, so I already was pretty familiar with the kids, who are 3 and 5. They can be busy, but are fun and usually fairly well behaved. I was on winter break from college so my schedule wasn't really too impacted by having to spend every day with my niece and nephew. My girlfriend was able to come over some of the time so that was pretty cool and made it easier. We played a lot of games with the kids, took them to the park often, and found ways to keep busy. I mostly enjoyed the time with the kids, and felt like I got to know them better than I did before. There was one incident where I got a little concerned. Melissa, the 3 year old, was playing with some toys when I heard her brother call from the other room. I went in the room pretty quickly and found him sitting on the floor holding his arm. He had tripped and fallen and landed pretty bad on the arm, and I could see some swelling and bruising already forming. I looked at it more closely and saw he could still move it, but wasn't sure if he needed to go the urgent care. I put some ice on it and got him some Motrin, and called his dad. If I had called is mom she would have gotten more upset I think. My brother told me to send him a picture and then he talked to Brian (his son). We ended up going to the urgent aid as a precaution, but everything turned out just fine thankfully. I learned how to make a few meals in during this time as well. My girlfriend and I experimented with making a few dishes from the recipes my brother and his wife had in their kitchen. I actually enjoyed it a lot, even if some of the meals weren't exactly 5-star. I made some chicken ricotta, pasta salads, salmon, soups, sandwiches, tacos, and more. My girlfriend enjoyed it too, and we talked about our future imagining what living together might be like.

The first one, of course, was my 23rd birthday. The second was that I celebrated my first birthday as a man instead of a woman! Last year was the first time I told anyone that I was transgender. When I first told my family and a few close friends, I was really worried that they would reject me. It took a lot of soul searching to go through with it. But except for my oldest sister, my family has accepted me as an evolving man and supported me. I did lose a couple of friends who just couldn't accept me as a man, but I've made new friends in the transgender community who went though the same things (or worse) that I did.

I had frequently thought about quitting but it was hard to find time to look for a new job with all of the responsibilites I had. I thought that I could find a better job. And I thought that I deserved better pay and more time off. Still I found it hard to actually apply for other jobs and go on interviews while doing my current job, doing housework, and exercising. I would get worked up and think that this was the end for me, that I was going to leave very soon. But then I would ease back into my job and take comfort in the familiarity of it. I liked the people I work with and didn't really want to leave them. Finally though I knew that I needed to leave. I started looking at job postings online. I wasn't sure where to begin really and worried that I was wasting my time writing cover letters to a bunch of companies that may not even look at it. After applying to what seemed like 50 jobs I had a few interviews and eventually offers from two of them. I was happy to recieve job offers and at least know that I could leave my job if I wanted to.

I value money and need money just in order to make my life easier, but I had never even considered how I could use that time off.

3RUIQRXJBCA5C09DHZ7RXVJ3JPELLV,"I loved to skateboard with my friends. Every Saturday we'd spend hours in the park performing tricks on our boards. We're a pretty competitive group, but we keep it civil.  A couple of months ago one of my friends saw this crazy skateboard trick on the internet. He sent the video link to all of us and I was amazed. The skateboarded in the video was five or six years younger than me but he was doing all kinds of cool flips and tricks on his board. Suddenly I felt old. I was completely floored by the kid's skill. My friends were too, but I pretended it was no big deal to me. If someone his age could do that then I could too. I read over the video's comment section to see if the skateboarder gave some out tips. He didn't. I re-watched the video until I figured out how to mimic the kid's moves. I must have watched it at least a hundred times. When I thought I was ready, I took my skateboard and my camera to the park and went to work. Two jumps, a flip, and a misplaced grind rail down three flights of stairs later, I ended up breaking my arm. After the surgery the doctor told me that my injuries would have been much worse if I wasn't wearing a helmet. I thought back to the video I watched and remembered that the kid wasn't wearing a helmet. When I got out of the hospital I checked the kid's video home page.

3KGTPGBS6Y72U4AZG7HN9MGDQH5U20,"My teaching practicum this year has been mostly uneventful and not at all difficult. I was feeling quite optimistic in my ability to become a good teacher, based on my experience thus far in the practicum. That is, until three weeks ago when a male student I am particularly fond of approached me before class and shared a personal situation that is causing him much anguish, making it difficult to concentrate on what's happening in the classroom and on his studies in general. He clearly came to me for comfort and reassurance, which I deeply felt moved to provide. Then he did such an odd and alarming thing, it has stayed in my mind and worried me ever since: he gave me a photograph of himself. He said he wanted me to have it ""to remember him by.""  Now I often find myself lying awake at night wondering if he just wanted me to remember him after my practicum is finished and I am no longer in his classroom, or if there is some darker, more ominous message in his gesture. There was a time in my life when I was so despairing I thought I couldn't go on living. Fortunately there was a very kind and wise psychologist who worked as a counselor at my high school and I had the presence of mind to take myself to see her. I credit her with helping me not only stay in school, but keep my grades up, study for the SAT, and send in my college applications. Having access to help can make all the difference in a young person's life. I have placed his photo on the mirror that hangs above my dresser, where I see it every morning and evening. Each time I wonder, could he be contemplating suicide? Surely I am being alarmist and reading too much into it, yet, the question will not go away.  I ask myself, what is my responsibility in this situation? Most importantly, how would a truly great teacher handle this? Finally, last night, after lying awake yet again with worry, I made the decision to speak to his teacher, in confidence, about the incident and my concern. I will ask not to tell him that I said anything or to do anything that would cause him to suspect I had, but I realize that may prove difficult. In the end, what matters is making sure he is safe from self-harm and has someone to talk to and a place to get help. I also hope to learn from this teacher, who has impressed me with her teaching style, how a good teacher manages such delicate matters as a student with a serious problem outside the classroom.  I am going to talk to her today after class. I am committed now to this course of action and praying it is the right one.","At the practicum placement I am at, there is a student I have bonded with.

37UQDCYH6YH9TKW5R98N1ZZ3QG97VO,"Three months ago I was in a wreck.  Thankfully, no one was seriously injured, but I was very frightened and upset.  Actually, I was in shock.  This was the first time I had ever been in an accident and I really hope it's the last time.  A man freaked out because he was surrounded by a motorcycle on each side of him and that caused the accident. My perspectiveAuto accidents can be very distressing.  When I was in my teens, my car was hit by a drunk driver while I was driving to a friend's house.  I was alone in the car.  It happened so quickly and so unexpectedly, I didn't have time to react or try to avoid being hit. He knocked my vehicle off the road and into a wooded area.  The windshield shattered, and several pieces of glass fell onto my lap.  I remember feeling stunned when it was over.  My hands were trembling and I couldn't open my car door - it had been pushed in too hard.  Several cars that witnessed the accident stopped to check on me, for which I was very grateful. The police arrived on the scene quickly.  They had to pry the driver side door off my car to get me out.  I still can't believe I wasn't seriously injured.  The police were rather aggressive with the other drive as it became very apparent that he was drunk.  They arrested him and took him away and then another officer very kindly drove me home, since my car was un-driveable. Writing the short summary about someone else's accident brought this memory rather vividly back to life for me.  Not the most pleasant experience of my life, but again, I was thankful neither I, nor the other driver, was seriously hurt.","I was in a wreck.

I want to start this by saying I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN A WRECK BEFORE. So I've just spent the last couple of days mentally processing. I think now I'm finally ready to talk about it.  Being on the interstate at night and going the speed limit, I was hit. Not totaled, so that's nice, but it did involve another man and it all happened really suddenly. The impact was enough to get a few dings and scratches, I was coherent for most of it though. The cars weren't great though. Somehow in the midst of stuff I wondered how much it would cost to fix. Did they pay my deductible? I still don't officially know the answer to that question. By the time I was able to get out of my car I saw the guy that had hit me.  He was FREAKING OUT. I was still in shock, I think, but I should probably have been more phased by seeing it than I was. I mean, he had a motorcycle on EACH SIDE OF HIM. There was blood, enough that continuing to take the scene in made me nauseous. I remember the screaming, watching him as I was spoken to by help, I can still see the way his arms looked against them.  I remember when the paramedics came just passing out.

It was only after the ride to the Hospital and I came to/as they went over the normal stuff that I had thought to wonder where he was. I still picture that scene in my minds eye and get freaked out.

One thing I really admired about Andrew Yang was his concern for my local county and the people that reside within it. He has made every effort to address poverty across county lines and speak to us about the rising opiod epidemic that's sweeping our nation. Not only that, he found ample time to speak about the dangers of climate change that we are currently experiencing today. He began with a very inspiring speech about how it was time to change our country and led us into a discussion about poverty within our city. He spoke about how it was unfair that so many sat within the streets, hungry and poor, while other's indulge on their riches and how that needed to change. He then went on to speak about climate change and how we needed to act today to ensure that our children won't have to deal with a failing planet when it's their turn to lead the world. Rising temperatures have been adding to our sea level which, within the next 50 years, will affect our children and our children's children, which is why we need to work to reduce emissions to have a clean Earth for them in the future. Lastly, he began to speak about how the opiod crisis is even affecting our county and the evidence is mounting that these people need mental treatment instead of constant arrests. They need to be cared for instead of shunned and we need to put ourselves in there places if we are to see exactly what they are going through. He also spoke about the actions of Washington and spoke about how it was important for us to not fall into that trap of hate and bigotry and instead lighten the world with our actions. How instead of shipping Mexican's back to there home country, that we will instead create a pathway to citizenship for these individuals so there kids aren't trapped in the very situation that they were running away from. He also spoke of the importance of culture within America and how that would be going against everything that we stand against.

My friend said the bill was on him and he looked around for our waiter. We got the guys attention and he came over to us.

I was so embarrassed. My husband is Mexican and I had no idea my friend had just racist thoughts.  I paid the bill instead and left the waiter a huge tip.  I know that cant make up for such racism but I felt I had to do something.  I walked out with my friend and I could feel my face still flaming from anger and embarrassment mental at his words. I told him before I left the parking lot that what he had said was uncalled for and racist. He looked at me like I was in the wrong. We havent spoken since.","While at a Mexican restaurant, my good friend said something absolutely insensitive to a stranger. It was the sad day I discovered my friend was racist.",60.0

He came to see my family with my step mother as part of an annual trip.  It happened to coincide this time with an annual fair our county holds.  We took the family to the fair and my dad got to see my children ride roller coasters and play games.  I took plenty of photos of him laughing and trying to get in a couple of the rides with them.  I recall giggling at the time when he couldn't quite fit into the seat of a tiny roller coaster car.  After the rides, we went over the petting zoo section.  He talked to my kids all about how to care for the chickens and goats that they encountered.  He purchased a cup of food for them to feed the animals with.  After we were done at the fair, we stopped at a restaurant that serves fun sandwiches.  I felt amused while my husband tried to pay the check.  My dad had already made sure to tell the server to give the whole check to him when we weren't looking.  That evening, after we put the kids to bed, we watched a movie in my living room.  The next day, they took their trip back to Florida, promising to see each other soon.  Unfortunately, that's a promise I can't keep.  I miss my dad.",This story when my dad was still alive.

A lot has happened over the years, and our relationship has been strained, but I think things are finally turning around. We've been spending a lot more time together, and talking fairly regularly. One of the areas of our relationship that I am working on improving is understanding her better. She used to complain that I didn't know much about her, or what she is into. Right before our big fight a few years ago, she complained that I've never bought her a custom gift, only thoughtless store-bought gifts. She didn't know this, but that day, I ordered a custom walking stick for her, since she loves hiking. I thought it would be perfect for her. Before the walking stick arrived though, she and I had a huge argument and she told me not to contact her. I couldn't bring myself to return the walking stick, so when it arrived, I kept it in its original box and kept it stored away, in case things ever worked out. A few months ago, I ran into her at a coffee shop and we talked for a few minutes. It went well, and we've been regularly texting and calling each other since then. We've visited each other a few times, and we both feel that the relationship is restored and back to normal. I went to her house for Christmas, and I decided to gift her with the walking stick. She loves it, and she's already sent me photos of her using it. She said it's perfect for her. She invited me to go hiking with her next weekend, and I am really looking forward to it.","After several years of very minimal communication my daughter has reached out to me and we are seemingly moving towards a better relationship.

3YHH42UU5C1SF4KRS6L8ZBRFF310LM,"I find myself pondering more and more about a bizarre event that happened to me about 2 months ago. The time for my graduate studies finals was fast approaching and I had been wracking my brain over all of the content that I had to master within the next two weeks. The stress was growing more and more overwhelming with each passing hour. It eventually got to the point where I started facing a bout of insomnia. No matter what I tried, I could not bring myself to fall asleep. This grew more problematic after several days of being unable to drift of into sleep. I was having difficulty commuting to class and paying attention to what the professors were saying. After several days, I began to find it difficult to distinguish between what was reality and what was illusion; a common symptom of insomnia. The most unsettling perception I encountered was a group of children unknown to me. They were playing together in a field within a park. As they ran around, they began to extend their hands toward a nearby playground. I could see some kind energy emanating from their fingers. Almost instantly after this began, the metal implements on the playground began to move on their own. Some tore out of the ground and began to whirl around in mid air. The children were creating their own magnetic waves and were thus able to manipulate metal around them. It reminded me of the character Magneto from the X-Men comics, though the children did not appear to have any malevolent intent. When I finally snapped out of this vision, I was honestly uncertain about whether or not what I had seen was real. Sleep deprivation had obviously gotten the better of me. It wasn't until my finals were over that I was finally able to get some sleep. Having had time to rest and put finals behind me, the perceptions from this experience have begun to coalesce in my consciousness and I find myself needing to figure out what the experience meant.","After being awake for several days, I lost touch with reality, or maybe not. Life is never the same after an experience that involves being fully convinced a group of children had the ability to generate magnetic polarity waves.",60.0
33L7PJKHCHKYG6XZWJ0EEH7ETWCT8J,"While I was living with my boyfriend, I got nostalgic, thinking about the times that I had with my family and friends. At first, everything was going well and we were living happily ever after. I found it exhilarating to be out and away from my familiar surroundings, as I would have to rely on my boyfriend to figure out how to get around. I soon noticed things about my boyfriend, as I have phases where I think very critically of people. More often, though, I have many phases where I see things that attracted me to this person. But, while thinking critically of my boyfriend, I noticed that he has certain moments where he gets very relaxed, during these phases, he takes things for granted. He is ok with laying on the ground to do repair work and sometimes urinate out in the open and he doesn't mind my seeing his private parts. He sees himself as a handyman and he doesn't like a lot of critical thinking that is required to solve problems related to mathematics and the physical sciences. He tends to or appears to get envious of me, when I want to talk about solving problems, so, when it comes up, he likes to switch topics. Over time, he either wanted to dominate conversations or not have talks at all. He likes to order me around, probably not fully realizing what he's doing, and, I have to depend on him for transportation. I would need to rely on him to get me back to my past living location, where I'm familiar with the area and have family and friends. When a confluence of things came together, I realized that I wanted to get back to familiar surroundings and around my family and friends. But, my concern about how he would feel about such a request made me hesitate to tell him that I'd prefer to be getting back around my friends and family soon. But, my critical mind kept me thinking about these features that he seems to have more and more, as time went on. So, out of mounting frustration, I came on him light and hinted that I would rather return some place to be much closer to family and friends. When first mentioned to him, he brushed it off, so, soon, I became more assertive, as required. So, one time, I was very abrasive and direct with him. He became sad, after being surprised that I really meant what I was saying. Thus, when he finally agreed to bring me back around family, friends, and familiar surrounds, things were such a relief for me, even considering his surprised and sad demeanor. I was so relieved, when I got back, in all honesty. But, after having a few days and weeks to consider our parting day, I started to become more and more considerate of his feelings. So, I started to communicate with him again, after some weeks and he was nice, relieved, and happy to be hearing from me again. I thought about the qualities that I liked about him and I wanted to ease back into a close nit with him, but, I would also still need some distance to be with my familiar surroundings. Things would have to grow on me and I would need to adapt.","My boyfriend and I had a misunderstanding.

While I do understand why I was fired for this act, I really do wish that the store would have given me a second chance back then or even a second chance right now. I was going through some hard times, and I really needed the extra food but could not seem to find it in my budget to make the purpose. I was rolling with a different crowd back then, and my lifestyle was not all that great. I have made some great strides over time though, and I feel that I have become a much better person. If only I was were this kind of person that day four months ago when I made the decision to steal. I have since distanced myself from the friends that led me into that situation, and have started to try to reconnect with old friends who may have a better influence on my life. I think so far they like me. They like me for who I am and not what I have, and they don't try to convince me to do anything out of my comfort zone. They are helping me realize that it is better to live a moral life, and it's actually not all that hard to do so. One of my friends, John, is even helping me prepare my resume and a cover letter to go back to the store with, and presenting my case to my old boss on why I should be re-hired for the job.

33SA9F9TRYG7HOBK4RRPTBAYC08WE7,"About a month ago, actually it might have been closer to 5 weeks ago, my boss came into my office and told me the one thing I did not want to hear. I was behind on bills as it was and I was counting on overtime for the next couple of months to catch up on what I had missed. In actuality I had spent more than I could afford on that vacation to Aruba but it was just something I had to do for my family. When your friends tell you that they are taking their whole families on a trip to Aruba and they want you to come, you don't pass that up. Those are memories that could last a lifetime. Anyway, I was trying to catch up on those bills and going through a ton of stress at work that carried over to home, I just couldn't help it. It was only a matter of time before it started to truly affect my work performance, I just didn't think it would happen so quickly. Juggling all my account while keeping the bosses happy was something that I was always able to do with minimal effort, I just think the amount of stress made me handle situations in ways I would never do and act in ways I should never act. It started when one of my biggest accounts called asking for follow up information on details regarding their last purchase. I just snapped, I told them they'd get it when they always got it and if it wasn't good enough then they should take their business elsewhere. Well they took that business elsewhere, right to my bosses and over my head. When my immediate supervisor confronted me about, I admittedly got defensive and told him to shove it, in so many words. Not my best decision. So that was 2 weeks ago. Since then everything had been going just fine, I applied myself harder than ever to make up for my bad decisions and told myself if I outworked everyone, everything would be okay. Well, when my second biggest account called asking to compare prices and look for ways to cut costs and my answer didn't suffice, that was the last straw. Since I had fixed all my mistakes and took care of everything I needed to, I felt like I hadn't done anything wrong. So when my boss came into my office with news that I had been let go it caught me off guard. I was not given a formal warning of any kind. I was shocked to be learning I wouldn't be getting severance pay and they would not even give me 2 weeks notice. I had a great run here at the company and I accomplished more than I ever thought I would. It's just so upsetting to see it end in this way. I'm ready for my next challenge.

This was very devastating new for us.  My family and his have been hounding us for grandchildren.  We play it off coolly, because we don't feel it necessary to involve them in our fertility issues.  It's our business.  After several years of failed fertility treatments, it because more and more painful to see my family members and friends experiencing births.

3R6P78PK7LXD9L3HFHC26UOCGXHGTD,Today I finally visited the Cascade mountain.  It is the highest peak of the Adirondacks mountain.  I have been wanting to make this hike for a long time and can't believe I finally did it!!  We started early in the morning to give ourselves plenty of time to make the climb and be able to enjoy the view.  It was cool and the air was so crisp.  I thought I might get tired as this was my first hike but my excitement and the distracton of the beautiful scenery kept me going.  I can remember seeing squirrels playing in the trees and hearing birds calling to each other.  I loved watching the sunrise along the way and watching the world wake up.  I loved to look at how the different trees and vegetation grew and appreciated the made trail for us.  I was surprised at how much colder it got as we wound our way higher and higher.  Once we made it to the top I couldn't believe we had made it and to see the beautiful views that are only afforded to those willing to climb to the peak.  As I surveyed the scenery I was amazed at how high we actually were and tried not to think about the descent home.   I was going to enjoy my time at the top and savor my journey for as long as possible.  We spent the afternoon at the peak and enjoyed a well deserved picnic lunch.  when it was finally time to go I took a deep breath and looked around trying to memorize each detail of this amazing journey.

I am usually a man with a plan and I formulated one quickly. You could barely see the house for how overgrown it had become. My first task was to clean up the front yard and give it some curb appeal. I mowed and trimmed the lawn and bushes and trimmed some of the tree branches the first weekend. It was then apparent that the front of the house, itself, needed some TLC. For my next and second weekend, it was going to be replacing a broken window pane and a ripped screen. All the windows needed washing and painting the trim would make a big difference. By the end of the second weekend, cars would slow down going by and I even had a few waves and appreciative nods. The next three weekend were spent inside the house, just do general cleaning, minor repairs, and clearing out a lot of junk and trash. The trash cans at the curb were full every week and I was making great progress. My last weekend, six altogether, was spent doing some finishing touches inside and out. I was standing back looking at all I had done and admiring the house and how it looked now, by comparison, when the neighbor, whom I have never met, stopped over to tell me how great it looked and how he appreciated it looking so much better.

33CKWXB73K6FWM15VF7PT11BMP211K,"I lost my 5 years job for a mistake.  The company was very ‘sales driven’ and as long as I created good ‘numbers’ nothing could happen to me. But making sales meant that the people who already joined our clubs didn’t get the attention they needed, and left. I preferred to embrace the existing members instead of the stress of gaining enough new members. To make a long story short, I wasn’t useful for the company anymore (although my clubs gained profit month after month) so I got kicked out of the company in a very bad way. My coworker was not reporting the spendings of projects as she should have been doing. From that time on I promised myself never to give a huge part of my time to a company that doesn’t give a shit about anyone, only themselves, to make lots of money. While sitting at home I decided to start a company so I would be able to do work I love, and to be in total control of what went right and wrong. In the beginning the company didn’t earn much money, so I found a part-time job working 3 days a week, which gave me the opportunity to earn enough money to pay the bills and still have 4 days to work for my own business. But it didn’t work that way. The evenings I was home from the part-time job I wasn’t very productive, which meant that I had to fit all the other stuff (like working on building my company) into the other 4 days, while in the weekends I had lots of assignments. So the actual time I had left to build up my company was reduced to one day a week. In other words: I couldn’t combine it anymore. For me it was clear my company is that one thing I love to do most, so if I want to make it work then I need 150% focus and time. Decision made.

I would go to sleep some nights, admittedly in tears, because there were certain points in my life where I felt unloved and nobody could possibly fall for me. My best friend, someone who clearly knew how I felt, tried his best to console me. It was hard to admit I was suffering. Little did he know that I had fallen for him a while ago. He just took great care of me and I felt safe when I was around him. One night, my feelings of wanting to confess overran the feelings of wanting to keep it a secret. I blurted it out because there was no good way to share the news. He stood there for a second, seemingly shocked. I had wondered if I just tarnished my friendship. But moments later, he told me he felt the same for me. I instantly became weak in the knees and a flush came over my face. I never thought this could happen to me.

Today was an ordinary day at work, with the only exception being that we had our monthly meeting that day. Everyone was to meet in the warehouse, and we all were to report there at a certain time. I usually like to arrive early, because if I were to arrive on time, that's when most people will be arriving and if I come late, that just looks bad on me. So, I sped through my lunch and went off to go to the meeting. Then, it happened. I was on my way to the meeting when I saw some water on the floor. I have ADD, so immediately, I wanted to go and get something to clean it. After going to the bathroom to get some towels, my mind jumped from one thing to another, and I realized I had to go to the bathroom. I stopped to go, and then realized I was now late to the meeting. In my hurry out, I completely forgot about the water I saw. I was hustling to get to the warehouse, when suddenly I feel myself slip in the very water I was supposed to clean.

We were best friends in high school and grew apart a little in college but still remained close. Then life happened. we both got full time jobs in different cities and that life thing kicked in. You know that part of being best friends is shared experiences and being able to remember them, talk about them and laugh. We had some great times when we were younger and hung out all the time, games, concerts ( the fight at ZZ top), and hunting. But, time moves on and people grow apart with distance, time,  and meeting other people. I know that is what happened to us. I feel really sad this happened because he was my best friend for almost 15 years. That being said, I know that we will keep in contact but it just wont be the same as it use to be.

It was miserable, I was so busy with a work deadline and looking down at my phone that I didn't even think about looking down to the sidewalk, I should have obviously because I tripped on an uneven section. I knew as soon as I hit the ground that this was really bad and the pain was immense. I had been carrying a coffee in one hand and cell phone in the other, I was covered in coffee and my cell phone screen was smashed. Thankfully it happened right near the coffee shop downtown so there we so many witnesses that someone was able to call an ambulance straight away! I guess that was one positive to the situation. It only took about 10 minutes for the ambulance to arrive but it felt like a life time. Thankfully the hospital is nearby and they transported me quickly. The wait once I got there to be seen was amazingly quick, I guess Tuesday mornings are quiet for hospitals. After the x-ray they announced I had broken and dislocated my ankle in two places, I guess that explained my extreme pain and the swelling! The doctor was so courteous and told me to not panic at the sight of my ankle, it looked horrendous. Dark gray and like nothing I have ever seen before. The funniest thing for me was that a friend texted me and said they had driven by at exact moment I fell, what are the chances of that ever happening?! The whole incident was embarrassing, I should have taken more care, I mean the amount of times that I have told my kids to get their faces out of their phones. The irony is I was trying to catch up my work and instead, I am incredibly behind now. I keep telling myself that it could have been worse and my ankle will heal. And thank goodness I had insurance on the cell phone!

Once we landed in Los Angeles I went to explain what happened and to catch the next flight to Vegas.  The lady at the desk then told me the next flight was in two hours to Las Vegas and they had two seats available that the cost would be $650. 00.  I finally made it to Vegas and had a good time.

3E47SOBEYRIAJV71JJHF2W1N9WWICR,I am very excited to be working for this company. They have made me look forward to working here. I look forward to knowing how to do my job and to become efficient at what i do. I look forward to learning new things and applying these new things. I am glad that i have gotten to know my coworkers as this was a big worrying point for me. I tend to be very reserved and quiet when i do not know a new work place. I have been able to overcome that. I have worked here for 8 months and i am surprised how much i get along with everyone at work. This has made me love my job. It has also become easier to be comfortable at what i do. I am surprised. My own family has said they see a change in me since i've started working here. At my old job i was constantly stressed. I was overworked. I never had time for my family or friends. There were many things i missed out on. Over time i got tired of my situation. I am glad i did. I feel better as a person and a worker. I look forward to many things now. I have even started working out again. I go for runs a few times a week. I visit my parents through out the week. I hang out with friends when i can. I have also found that i have created many close relationships with my coworkers.,I recently started a job at a software company. It was a very enriching experience.

When I was a kid he wasn't married and he would take my brother and I to do all kinds of fun stuff, and he was kind of like a big brother and a second father in one. I remember playing monopoly with him, going to the park, he even took us on dates with him and the woman he would marry. Last year I was told via facebook that he went to the hospital with pneumonia. I was worried but I assumed he'd be ok, because it's not like that's uncommon, and if he's at the hospital he'd be fine. But then my dad called the next day and told me they found spots in his lungs. Then they said it was cancer. Apparently it started in his kidney and had already spread all over his body. It was also in his brain and some other places. Then I was really terrified. I bought a plane ticket home but when I landed I checked my phone and my dad had called. I listened to the message and he said my uncle had had cardiac arrest and died.

His legs were getting very weak and he could no longer stand properly. We would have to give him his pain medication 3 times a times a day. Even then he would sometimes howl in pain periodically. My brother who had also grow up with Zeus suggested that it might be time to put the dog down. My-self and most of my immediate family were ready not to put him down so we decided to wait. this was a mistake, as the poor dog's condition worsened day by day. eventually it got to the point where the medication did not help ew had to come to a decision as a family.

Though she was only halfway through her pregnancy, she was experiencing some pain and doctors couldn't figure it out.

I could only think of my old college roommate, Kim, who went through something similar and ended up losing her child after only a few months. Though I spoke with Julie to reassure her, I remained scared at the possibility of something seriously bad happening. Then, one afternoon maybe five months ago, I received a text from her husband that nearly put me in shock. He said that she was forced into labor early and both her and the baby were on life support. This was the worst news I could have ever imagined. My jaw was on the floor. I wasn't sure what I should do. I called her husband again but he did not answer. That's when I really started to panic.

3U0SRXB7CER63Y7BYWK2WZWRTO0NR9,"Four months ago, I was at the humane society at 7am. The first thing that I was asked to do was feed all of the animals. There were were a lot more dogs than there were cats, which made me pretty happy because I don't care for cats that much. I finished doing all of that and watched them all chow down on some good quality kibble that someone had donated the day before. I was told that they don't receive a lot of high quality food donations, so this was really helpful. There are so many dogs here that it takes a large bag of kibble a day just to keep them fed. After feeding them all, it was time to start bathing the new pets that were brought to us this morning. I'm most comfortable washing small dogs, so I washed the 2 pomeranians that were brought in and left the Rottweiler to someone more experienced than me. I loved both of the little fluff balls, but the white one (a girl) was not happy with her bath at all. She was nervous and whining the entire time, while the brown one (a boy) was a champ about the whole thing. I bathed the white one first so she could get out and get dried off I was able to use a blow dryer on her, so she got dry pretty quickly. The boy pom was a lot easier to deal with, so it didn't take me long to bathe him off. They were both infested with fleas, the poor things. I get upset when I see animals mistreated like this. There's no excuse to be eaten up with fleas like that at all. All it takes is a regular bath to keep them mostly off and I don't understand why people can't do that like they're supposed to.

We purchased their best plants and then headed out to enjoy the rest of the nature and scenery as well as a few other fun activities. We decided to do a bit of hiking in some near by woods, set down on a homemade blanket my mom made me when I was 12 and enjoyed our surroundings whilst lighting up a blaze. I laid back to admire the tall tress reaching for the heavens, I closed my eyes to listen to the wind blowing through the leaves. I could hear the others laughing and talking among themselves and I smiled, I smiled because they were smiling. I stretched out my arms, stretched them out as wide as I could, as if I was trying to each either side of the woods. I dug my fingers into the soil, as the soil dug back deep underneath my finger nails.

I'm not much for throwing my coins down the toilet so I just watched the others and after just a bit we left. When we finally got to the ranch my head was a bit funny, I had the giggles and the horses were absolutely stunning. We went into the barn to pick out the horses we wanted and I picked out the one that I felt was my spirit animal, her name was June and she was magnificent. We all got saddled up and started along a path, the sun was shinning, the whether was perfect and I had this powerful beast between my legs, it was turning out to be the perfect day, until I slipped off and nearly busted my ass; turns out I got so wrapped up in the moment that I forgot to hold on to the reins. After falling off the horse, I was a little shook but I barely felt a thing, thanks to the legal plants we part took earlier that day. We headed to a local dinner after the ranch, being that we were all starving and/or had the munchies; I ordered something greasy and unhealthy, like the rest; I promise to hit the gym sometime next Tuesday. After a long day we all headed back, I fell asleep in the back of the car, my head resting of the shoulder of my BFF and my wannabe lover, with the light summer breeze on my skin, and a smile permanently print on my soul...This was definitely a day I will always remember.","Took a vacation to Colorado.

She recommended that I have a fine needle test poke done to see what it could be.  After a few days I received the test results.  They seemed unsure as to what it was but there seemed to be some bad cells in her report.  I was advised to do a lymph node biopsy right away.

It is one of my favorite things about him, how romantic he can be. For our 3rd wedding anniversary we had the idea to go and eat dinner. The special aspect of this particular event was the fact that we went to the resort we got married at. It was great going there, the nostalgia I felt made me very happy. I enjoyed the wedding immensely and you could tell not much had changed there. The resort is a beautiful place, I felt as though I was welcomed right away, and I really enjoyed the food. I think my husband knew how much I enjoyed being there, because he seemed very contented with himself the entire evening. Needless to say we both enjoyed ourselves a great deal. We had a lot of fun and the food was delicious. I will admit we had more wine than we probably should have. The entrees were actually reasonably priced as well. I think it is safe to say we will be going back to this place in the future as well. I am so grateful to my husband for how thoughtful he is. He is very good at telling what I like and appreciate.

We like to make sure to commemorate such events because it helps us to take time to pause and reflect on the status of our relationship as well as the good and bad things we've been through together. We are planning a big trip for our fifth anniversary but for this less monumental third anniversary, we decided to just celebrate by going to dinner at the resort where we were married. The anniversary was on a Tuesday night, so we didn't think the resort would be crowded and we were correct. We had reservations for 7 PM and I was able to leave work early that day to get my hair done for the occasion. I also had a special teal dress that matched one of our wedding colors. The resort was not crowded so we were able to get the best seat in the restaurant. We had a table overlooking the pier while the sun set. It was a beautiful blaze of orange and pink and reflected wonderfully off the water. I took a few photos to remember the view. We ordered some drinks and our dinner. Service was great because the restaurant was not crowded so our waiter was not juggling too many tables. The food was excellent as it always is at that restaurant. After we ate, we wanted to go to the exact spot where we said our vows. There's a large field next to the pier. Of course, the scene was not the same as wedding day as no arch was set up but we were able to find a bench near the exact spot where we could sit and look at the water in the moonlight while we talked about the first three years of our marriage and what we see for the years ahead.

3U088ZLJVLF8QYWQWKSA8M8UNO9W0F,"I retired at the age of 38 on June 6, 2017, the day before the twentieth anniversary of my high school graduation. I am married with no kids and generated over 95% of the family income while employed. We live in LCOL rural TN. Our asset allocation is approximately 60% VTSAX (total US stock market) / 20% VFWAX (total INTL stock market) / 20% VWLUX (US municipal bonds). We also hold roughly $400k in house, land, and belongings not included in the portfolio. My spending model places no dependence upon possible future employment (outside pharmacy?), social security ($10k/yr?), inheritance ($500k?), house equity (reverse mortgage with no heirs?), universal health care (probable?), or universal basic income (possible?). The final balance will be left to charities and worthy causes. Two years later: A wild year for the market, but everything seems to be going as planned. We entered year two of early retirement at $1.146M on 6/1, peaked at $1.199M on 9/20, bottomed at $1.008M on 12/24, peaked again at $1.202M on 5/3, and finished back down at $1.138M. I think the concept of retiring early must include shaping a new, purposeful identity, whether that is in some kind of nonprofit work, traveling, writing, managing investments, etc. Peter Drucker talks about this concept in Managing Oneself, in that truly successful people work at their encore career/retirement plan and skills needed years before it happens. Our need to create and contribute doesn’t have to take the shape of work, but it doesn’t go away. And if we’re not purposeful about it then it becomes whatever we are already doing. I'd have an identity crisis if I was suddenly ""not a programmer"", but barring brain damage, nothing is going to make me ""not a programmer"", certainly not retiring. Financial security, even without the RE portion, will provide a permanent happiness boost for most people. It’s only after you leave your job do you truly realize how wound up you were in your profession.","I left my job for the last time.  I was retiring.  I had mixed feelings, but it was time.

I wanted to travel and spend more time with my family. I wanted time for myself. My company was having a big retirement party for me. They laid out a big spread of food and there was a delicious retirement cake. My company gave me a watch to thank me for my 25 years of service.

The reason I say this is because at that time something happened that changed my outlook on life.  My husband and I were driving on a trip to Boston up north and almost got into a car crash. This was a turning point in our lives to be honest. I say this also because that alone changed my way of thinking on two fronts. The first thing that came to mind was how fragile our lives are and that was scary. Also how quickly things change, almost in the blink of an eye.  During that time it happened I was taken aback because I just kind of coasted. I nor him ever even thought about life without each other so that alone scared me.

Something had to be done, and I didn't know where to start. My life felt like it was going downhill fast and there was nothing that I could do to stop it. I got help from a friend and he suggested that I really need to just watch what I eat and try to get on a set sleep schedule. I knew that those were some of my problems, and I wanted to fix them all, so if that was the start then I'd try. It went well and I could tell that sleeping better and more regularly was a big help. I started to feel healthier and things became less of a struggle. I started being motivated to live and wake up. I wanted to keep improving. I was trying so hard now because I could see improvements. I could tell I was making progress both physically and mentally.

I really want to keep it, but I work up to ten hours a day so that wouldn't be fair to the kitten. The first step was to take it to the vet.  I knew there would be vaccinations and a de-worming involved. I figured I would ask the vet who could help me find the little guy a home. At the vet, I sat in the lobby with a few other people. The kitten was nice and warm in my hoodie. An older lady was there, looking tearful at the desk. I did some eavesdropping and figured out that she had just put her older cat down. A light bulb moment. I didn't waste any time thinking about whether or not this was a good  idea. Before I could tell myself to mind my own business I said, ""ma'am are you interested in adopting a kitten?"" She wiped her eyes and looked at me cautiously.

Stop at the Steel Visitor Center for your first taste of rustic lodge architecture—look for the “snow tunnel”—and to watch the short but instructive film on the lake’s origins. en proceed to Rim Village, where you’ll see license plates representing just about every state and Canadian province and hear myriad languages. Here you can catch your first glimpse of the legendary blue water and stretch your legs on the Discovery Point Trail. Easy enough for families with young children, the 1.3-mile trail parallels Rim Drive, offering several tantalizing views of the lake with virtually no elevation gain. Want more? Continue on to the fire lookout at Watchman Peak, which, at 8,013 feet, is one of the highest points in the park. After the steep climb, enjoy the payoff: an unparalleled view of Wizard Island in its bowl of blue. You’re in for a treat, because you planned ahead—way ahead—and booked a room in the Crater Lake Lodge. Originally completed in 1915, this classic example of “Parkitecture” was almost lost. The building was failing under the heavy snow loads each winter, and it took a huge public outcry—and great expense—to prevent its razing. Though much of the lodge was re-built entirely, the design remains true to and even improves upon the original vision, with larger guest rooms and updated amenities. Step into a different century and enter the splendid dining room, with its unpeeled tree trunk columns, exposed wood ceilings, large windows and muscular stonework. Or, if the weather cooperates, sit on the veranda and sip Chardonnay while contemplating the view. e experience is made even lovelier with Northwest fare such as sweet corn fritters, field green salad with Oregonzola cheese, and balsamic-glazed lamb chops. If day one was all about the views, today is about getting up close and personal with an open-air boat tour of the lake. Pack a picnic and take East Rim Drive to the Cleetwood Cove Trail, which provides the only legal shore access in the park. If you’re brave, launch yourself off a short cliff once you reach the shore. Brace yourself: the water averages 55 degrees, even in August",The trip to Crater Lake in the summer with my girlfriend was truly unforgettable.

Unlike some people that realize too late they missed time with a loved one, I get to start over now.  The day started like any other day.  I mindlessly went through my routine, made sure my spouse was ready for work, and dropped my kid off at school.  Nothing different happened that morning or during that day.  Like normal, I just did my job, made some money, ran errands, cleaned the house, and started some things for dinner.  I had coffee with my friend, chatting about our many responsibilities and how grateful we were for any breaks from spending time with others, how heavy our workloads were and how school gave us a little break in our day from childcare. That afternoon, I went to go pick up my kid from school.  I ended up driving behind that same friend, who had kids in the same school.  There was a school bus stopped along the rode, which was a rural highway.  I saw it and slowed down, but my friend in front of my didn't see it.  She ran right over children who were getting off the bus.  The kids were killed in that horrible accident.  My friend couldn't even offer condolences; she was just saying how busy she was and that she didn't see.  She was too busy to see the bus stopped, too busy to see the precious lives in front of her...too busy...too busy.  I picked up my kid and went home, too moved to eat dinner that night.  I could have been that woman: too busy to see; too busy with what?  Too busy with chores that never end to spend precious time with loved ones?  Too busy to spend time praying, or doing worthwhile hobbies that I enjoy?  Am I too busy to pass those hobbies, those precious moments and memories on to my kids?  I realized that I had been going through life numb, as if on auto-pilot, just checking off tasks on a list.  All the while, the things that truly matter were passing me by.  I hugged my spouse and child close, and determined that I would no longer miss what's important in life.

3FUI0JHJPYK7GSTZ5NZR5NV5JH733W,"Parenting a child with behavioral issues might just be the hardest thing I have ever done.  When our son, Jackson, started preschool, notes and telephone calls from his teachers regarding his inattentiveness began almost immediately.  He had difficulty sitting still during circle time and couldn't keep his hands and feet to himself.  He often started an activity, scribbled something on a piece of paper, and then would walk off to begin another activity. He couldn't concentrate long enough to finish his work.  This pattern of behavior followed him to elementary school where the classes were larger and the interruptions and misbehavior had bigger implications.  My husband and I had always recognized that Jackson had difficulties keeping himself occupied at home.  We eventually stopped attending church because his disruptiveness during the service was embarrassing. He'd crawl under the pews, roll around on the floor, and would often yawn loudly during sermons.  Despite our best efforts to discipline him, set boundaries, and accommodate his misbehavior, we felt like we were failing him.  Eventually, when he turned seven, we took him to his pediatrician, and she immediately diagnosed him with ADHD.  We felt a sense of relief that we had professional confirmation.  That was four months ago, and my husband and I are still grappling with both his diagnosis and whether or not to medicate him.  I've talked with several friends and family members who either have ADHD themselves or parent a child with the disorder.  The parents almost unanimously sing the praises of medication, claiming that the positive effects completely outweigh the negative effects such as lack of appetite.  However, the feedback from those who have ADHD and have taken medication has been somewhat of a mixed bag.  Some have told us about the depression that seems to appear once the medication regime has begun.  Others claim that lack of appetite is by far the worst side effect.  They all have conceded that they are more focused, able to complete work or activities, and feel like they are able to fit in with peers during events.  My husband and I remain undecided as to whether or not we want Jackson to take medication that might help him succeed in school, but would come at a price.  Do the benefits outweigh the costs, and are we willing to gamble with our son's brain and mental state in order for him to ""fit in?""  How will he live his life with this label of ADHD?","My seven year old son was diagnosed several months ago with ADHD.

Since this trip was only about 3 months ago, the memories are still very fresh and upfront in my mind.   My friends and I had done research a week or two before we left so we knew which excursions we wanted to take.   My favorite excursion was when we toured some ancient ruins which showed the way that the indigenous people pf Mexico originally lived.   I learned that in these cultures, it was not uncommon for the tribesman to run barefoot from one village to the next - which was sometimes as much as 50 miles.  It was amazing to learn how this activity evolved the culture into these super-athletes who had amazing endurance and stamina.    Another favorite excursion was a tour of a real Mexican plant where authentic Mexican food is made.  After the tour, my friends and I ate an amazing meal of true authentic Mexican food that was out of this world.  At the end of the meal, a mariachi band came over to serenade me with an authentic rendition of ""Happy Birthday""!  I thanked my friends for setting up this amazing surprise.   Another favorite excursion was our trip out to a Mexican ranching farm.   We learned about some of the differences between ranch farming in the U.S. as compared to Mexico.   I was impressed with the dedication and commitment that Mexican ranch farmers have to make to succeed in this business due to the hot climate and dusty terrain.

My father had been struggling with cancer, and my mother was obviously in despair about this.  It was a rough time for all of us, especially because money was tight with the cost of medication.  I tried to help as often as I could.  One night, some people broke into my parents home and stole money - WHILE my dad was on his deathbed.  I found out later that they were drug dealers coming to collect money that my parents owed them.  Dad had been using marijuana and other drugs to make himself more comfortable while he died slowly.  Its not something I would normally approved of, but I did understand in this circumstance. The hospital would offer no help unless he was admitted - in which case they could offer morphine for the pain.  But, the hospital stay was incredibly costly and the insurance only covered a portion of it, so it was actually cheaper to use the drug dealers....or so they thought.  I gave my mom some money to help get by until their next pension payments came in.   Mom needed to get dad some more morphine from the dealers, and this time, the upped the price.  When my mom refused to pay the additional money to them, they snatched her purse and stole all the cash she had brought with her, AND didn't even give her anything in return.  I felt horrible to watch my parents suffer through this, let alone to have to deal with it while dad was in such dire straits.  I felt useless and helpless - I still do.  I remember telling my mom that I couldn't give her anymore money to be robbed or wasted, but she refused to tell me where to obtain the drugs so I could deal with it, but she refused to tell me who they were out of fear.

My grades were all well enough to get in and as a matter of a fact I did get widely accepted to many law schools.  I had one major downfall, all the scholarship programs were taken, well all the ones that offer 100% Scholarship. I think it was because I didn't apply early enough and couldn't get a vacant scholarship spot. That's a major problem for me.  I cannot afford to go to Law School, even if I had a full time job I couldn't afford it.  Also, I would have to think about when I would be able to study and do the assigned homework.  I'm very frustrated right now. It has always been my dream to go to law school. I can remember watching all the crime TV shows and trying to predict out comes. I fantasize about being a high level attorney in New York city, with my name posted on the firm its self one day.  Although right now I cannot go because i simply cannot afford to go.  I've worked so hard to get in. Its brings me much pain the money it's the determining factor to taking my first step towards the rest of my life.  I don't think its over by a long shot.

Now that I'm older, I am still freaked out by it but decided to follow my fear and do it anyway. What a thrill! We did some surfing on the artificial waves and got on a few more rides after waiting in line for what seemed like hours. Met with the group for lunch and had some of the park's famous Impossible Burgers. I have to say that I wasn't disappointed. After the birthday festivities, we decided to go to a Salsa Nightclub and dance the night away. The more I drank, the more creative my dance moves got.

I however, decided to be a responsible adult and drag my self out of bed. Bill was a sweet kid and I knew he really wanted his uncle to be there. To be honest I was pretty miserable for most of the ride. The car was definitely not helping my nausea but I eventually fell a sleep, which I'm sure was a relief to Dave.

There were some yard games  set up like darts and volleyball. Bill's dad had the grill set up and seemed to be cooking up a feast which was great cause I was starving now.

I have friends and all but definitely not the kind of guy to go hang out every night. With Beth it is different though. We have a lot of the same interest so when we go out we have no problem coming up with something we will both enjoy. Even better we are both content to hang out watching movies or talking until late. It's been 5 months and I swear we might never run out of things to talk about. Not that we always agree but we both no that there are different ways to look at things and no way is 100% the only way. In fact I respect her opinion on many things that I don't necessarily agree with her about like economics. What really surprised me was that I found this great person at work. Who would have though my soulmate would turn out to be one of my colleagues. Especially at this gloomy office. I know I should be concerned about the possible consequences of dating someone I work with but honestly I'm to happy to care right now.

We both love to swim and it is very important to us to have a house that has a pool in the backyard where we can swim, relax, and have pool parties with our friends.  I was beginning to get discouraged because we had not found anything we liked yet and had been looking for awhile, but three weeks ago we found the perfect home.  We made an offer and the seller accepted!  I was very nervous when waiting to hear if our offer had been accepted.  Now we are dealing with the closing of the sale.  I must say, this part is difficult and nerve wracking too.  I'm nervous about the inspection and the appraisal too.  I keep feeling like something will fall through and there is so much to attend to.  I never knew buying a house could be so stressful.  At this point, we have been a little surprised by how accommodating the seller has seemed to be.  They even offered to fix up a few things we didn't like about the house which I was not expecting them to do.  Either they are suspiciously nice or we got lucky, I'm not sure!

Then we faced the toughest team in the city in the finals. Despite having a nice lead at half time, we struggled in the second half. The game came down to the final few minutes, where we led by a mere one point. In an effort to grab a rebound and give us a nice advantage, I was fouled extremely hard and came down badly on my knee. Right away I knew it was bad. I spent a few minutes writhing around in pain before being helped off the court. I was forced to sit on the bench and ice my knee while the final minutes ticked away.

3QAVNHZ3ENQOGHI9K8I1OH3R0QPLAM,"Three months ago was the annual family vacation. This year we decided to be a little more adventurous and spend a week in Yellowstone National Park. My wife and I had started to be more physically active in an attempt to be have a healthier lifestyle. We had always wanted to go camping together, but haven't had the time. Our wedding registry actually consisted of mostly camping and outdoor gear, and now we have a chance to use it. After arriving at the park, we scouted out a nice area to setup camp near Lamar Valley. This area was chosen primarily because of reviews about the hiking trail. After two nights of eating hot dogs cooked on a campfire, we decided we would go hiking in the morning. We packed our backpacks with some trail mix, beef jerky and some extra water. After a big breakfast we began our journey of the hike. The scenery was incredible! We took a lot of pictures of the view with my wife and I posing for selfies and silly poses. While I was taking a picture of my wife up against a tree, I saw a figure move behind the tree. I put up a finger to shush my wife and motioned for her to creep towards me. She turns around and sees a bear 15 feet from her and screams! I began to roar at the bear and make very loud noises trying to scare it away. Amazingly enough, the bear ran away back into the woods and we raced back to our camp. We escaped with no physical harm done, although it was mentally jarring and nerve wrecking. The rest of the camping trick was spent at our campsite as we were too scared to continue hiking. The trip was overall enjoyable and we had a good time.","I had decided to go on a hike in Lamar Valley during a week trip to Yellowstone National Park.

While I was there, I wanted to go for a hike and found a trail in Lamar Valley so I decided I would take some time to go. The trail was so nice and peaceful, but as the sun started to set, I started hearing some heavy footsteps nearby. I stopped in my tracks as I didn't know if it was another person or an animal. In that moment, I really wished that I brought someone with me. I was getting really nervous and scared of what I would see. I was completely surprised when I saw that a BEAR had walked close to the trail. I tried to stay calm as I tried to think back to what I knew about bears. I stayed quiet so I didn't bring the attention to me. I slowly walked away while trying to stay light on my feet. My heart was pounding the entire time. The bear kept moving further along the trail so I went back towards the entrance so I could get back to safety. Luckily, I was able to get far enough from the bear that I could walk normally the rest of the way. That was one of the scariest moments of my life.

After 6 years of marriage with my wife, we decided to separate. There are some things in life that cannot be reconciled, but when it comes to children, sacrifices must be made. A few months prior to our separation, my supervisor at the electronics factory advised me that I would have to begin working overseas in China due to the increased costs of production in our country, and if I refused, I would lose my job and status in the company indefinitely. I was devastated to hear this, my supervisor of  10 years put me in this tough situation of choosing whether i leave my family or leave my job. There were many things to consider, first off, after working under this supervisor for about a decade, I accumulated quite a lot of pay raises and perks to my job that made living easy for my family and I, and it wasn't easy to find the same things in another job. With my family, my daughter recently started middle-school and at this time in her life, it would be beneficial for her to make stable friends and develop relationships that last throughout her life. My wife didn't  like the idea of moving overseas because of her losing her job and our daughter's social health not being right. I did not know what to do in this situation whatsoever. I was angry with my supervisor for not offering me another position in the United States or referring me to another organization. I was also angry with my wife since she didn't want to come with me to China and start a new life over there. While i understood her concerns about not living there, I was still determined to pick up this new job position and continue working for the same company. Even though I made this tough decision and I knew this would come, my wife and I decided to separate because of this. In all honesty, separating was the hardest thing for me to overcome emotionally. We could not come to terms and agree on how things should be and for the sake of my daughter, we decided that my wife and her would stay in the USA while i travelled to China and lived there to do my work.","my husband and i decided to separate.

I recently heard that a managerial job had opened up and they were hiring, I thought this is my chance. I've always wanted to be able to work my way up in a job especially one I enjoyed and that it would be amazing to get this job. I've been working so hard and trying my best so I really thought I had a shot but I over heard some of my coworkers talking and saying that Jenny, who has been here a little longer than me was probably going to get the job.

Jenny has been there longer and she does a good job and gets along well with our supervisors/bosses. I get along with them pretty well too just not to the point that Jenny does, but even though Jenny does her job well, I know I worked way harder, not to put Jenny down but I always work overtime and always volunteer for stuff. I had given up all hope of getting the job, I've had past experience in jobs that I've seen that usually the one the higher ups get along with or like the most usually got better treatment and jobs regardless of how well they worked before. I was really sad but one day my supervisor comes up to me and says ""Hey Sara, so we are looking in to hiring someone for the manager position and kind of looking at our options and we are considering you for the job."" I couldn't believe it, I honestly thought with everything I wouldn't be considered. I say ""Thank you, that's great.""

Before long over 20 years passed and I realized something was missing, I wanted a Masters degree, it never left my mind. The opportunity was present and I am so glad I finally took it. But what really matters on this special day is not only proving to myself I could do it, but showing my Daughter to never give up. The pride I feel inside from accomplishing my goal, but the feeling of completeness there is from my Daughter receiving her Masters the same day is indescribable. I remember what started me on this quest, my parents wanted me to be ""educated"" and in their eyes it meant a Masters degree. The told me continuously to start classes, to get moving on it, at times there were almost relentless about it. I could see it in their eyes, how very much they wanted me to complete my education, I felt that drive in them, that sense of pride they would have in me. Before they passed away I made a promise, to me I took an oath in their presence, that I would no matter what complete my Masters degree. They never let me forget that promise, my mother reminded me of it daily, my father talked about it often and I carried that around with me until this day. I remember sharing the story with my Daughter, the promise I made to her grandparents and what it meant to them and me. At first she could not grasp the meaning of it all to me, the sense of gratitude I had for my parents as well as what it meant to them for me to get my higher level degree. I finally got through to my daughter about how I felt, how my parents felt and how to me it tied in with her getting her Masters on the same day. She always knew how I beam with pride over her, all her accomplishments and dedication to studying. It brought me great happiness to be able to share the day with her, to get a degree the same time she did. I feel inside now a true sense of calm, knowing my family is proud of me, I set a good example for my daughter and my parents can rest.

They have sports on most of the time but they also have some local favorite bands we all enjoy.  Joe's birthday was on a Wednesday so we thought we should have it the Saturday before so he would really be surprised.  A friend of Joe's volunteered to keep him busy that Saturday.  That worked out great, giving the rest of us plenty of time to get everything set up in the back room at Ike's.  We decorated a little with some sports stuff and some black balloons.  Everyone showed up around 6 and milled around til we got the news they were on the way.  As they entered the bar, the bartender greeted them loudly enough so we knew it was time.  As they entered the room, Joe's parents were the first people he saw.  Behind him were about 20 others, all yelling ""Happy Birthday Joe!"", as loud as they could.  Everyone seemed to have such a good time and Joe was totally surprised.  At one point, the singer who was working that evening came in and sang Happy Birthday to Joe and we all joined in.

I was really nervous driving especially since there were so many trees blowing and limbs coming down.  There was also a lot of lightning.  I wasn't sure if I should keep driving or try to find someplace to stop for a while, but all the other cars were still driving so I thought it was ok to keep going.  It was the highway so it seemed safer than smaller local roads.  I was almost home when I saw someone soaked walking on the side of the road.  At first, I felt really bad that I was going to pass this person by because he looked so forlorn.  However, I was nervous about picking someone up because what if they were dangerous.  Also, I wanted to get home as soon as possible.  I don't know what made me stop, but I did and asked the man if he needed a ride.  It turned out to be someone living a few blocks from me.  He didn't want to get in at first and I admit I was nervous, but with all the rain the lightning I tried to convince him it wasn't safe.  He got in and was really wet!  I guess he looked like a businessman so I thought it would be safe.  As I started to drive off, I heard a huge boom and crack!  A tree and lots of branches fell right where my car was and where the man was walking!  It had to be good karma or divine intervention that saved us because we could have been crushed.  This whole experience made me more willing to help others and to reach out because if I were in that same situation, I would want to be helped.

Lately we have been talking on the phone a lot about me being deployed, so it was touching to receive such a big cake. I know Brian's brother served multiple tours a while back, so he understands what it means when a deployment is looming. Aside from the crazy cake, we had tons of food on his new industrial sized grill. He bought three types of burgers, tons of brats, hot dogs, and all the vegan options available. In addition we had at least a half dozen large coolers filled beer and water.

About 7 weeks ago she decided  that she had seen enough of the lifeless, non fruit bearing trees that were anything but pleasing to the eye. In my opinion there simply was no rush to have them taken down as they provided shelter for the wildlife.

We thought, and had good reason to believe, she would live into her teens. My cousin was devastated, of course. I'd only met her a few times, so I wasn't as affected, but I still was. It reminded me of the fact that I'm getting older, she was the first family member of mine who was younger than me, who had died. I flew to the west coast for the funeral a few days later, it was very sad seeing her little body in the casket. The service was short, and nobody had too much to say, perhaps because her life had been so short. Later we went back to my cousin's place, and when some of the older family members left, we got pretty drunk. My cousin told me that losing her was the worst thing he'd ever experienced, that since I didn't have a child myself I couldn't understand, and I tend to agree with him. His wife came down and told him to stop drinking and come to bed, and I said goodnight to him. I sat up for awhile drinking beer and watching television by myself, and I wondered how I would handle the loss of my own child, or if I'd ever even have children of my own. The next day I woke up with a bad hangover, and flew home, and I was glad to be back and not living that situation anymore, at least for the moment. I knew, however, that as I continued to get older, this would happen more and more often. I can't say that I'm looking forward to it.",A cousin's child died and made me question life and death.

On the second half, they equalized and that is when i new that football was like a game of cards and the tables can change at any given time We had to do something. Time was not on our side. We had to change the attack pattern and do it fast. We  needed one more goal to make the difference. Ten minutes to full time, Joe sent me a cross that changed the game. I was in a good position to score but chose to pass it to the Captain who was in a better position than me. It was a smooth pass but i was attacked from behind and fell to the ground. The Captain had netted it and we were on the lead again. My head was throbbing and i was substituted. The game ended well. We won. Back at home and i was feeling better.

The theatre itself has changed since I was a kid. The seats now are cushioned and recline. There's an ordering service for food and drink. Probably the biggest difference though was the high cost to see a movie. Despite the cost, we had a great time. This was 2 months ago now but I still think about it often. I remember that my youngest sat on my lap while my older child sat beside me and held my hand. My sister's kids did a lot of whispering back and forth at first but eventually settled down to watch the movie.

When I was pulling into the parking lot, I noticed an old woman who looked like she was dressed as a character from game of thrones, walking in the entrance. I parked and got out of my car to head in. When I got in, I grabbed a cart and headed to the breakfast isle. When I turned the corner, I saw the old woman again. She was trying to grab a thing of oatmeal off of the top shelf and could not reach it. Since I am pretty tall and have no problem reaching that high I asked her did she need any help. She said that was very kind of me as I grabbed the box down for her. She noticed the way that I was looking at her outfit and chuckled at me. She then told me that I probably thought that she was crazy because of the way she was dressed. I then told here that it was a very unusual outfit to go shopping for groceries in. She then told me that her son had died last year and his favorite thing to do was go larping. After he died, she joined his group to pay homage for him. She said that she was running a little late today because she had to come pick up food for the picnic that they always have after a battle. I told her that I am sure her son would be happy that she was doing it. She then proceeded to invite me to come join her today.

39K0FND3AI18MZ0UKKJGOUIG0W4AM4,I never thought about math as something to struggle with. Numbers came easily to me and so did math. When I was asked to TA a class over the summer I was a bit apprehensive because I didnt know what I was supposed to really help with. The professor teaching the class really struggled with explaining things in a meaningful way. Those that took an interest in learning came to me and loved my explanations. I was told 3 weeks ago by the school that they had gotten many glowing positive comments from the students. They were very appreciative of how i listened to them and helped them. it really made me feel good about how I teach and what i could do to help. I am considering doing another course in the fall provided I can get the job back. I also considered getting an adjunct job after graduating with my masters. Sometimes its a matter of taking the time to listen to the needs of others. It was humbling to be involved in such an impactful way. I will always remember the kind comments I got. I hope others can learn from me and share what I shared. Overall this was a very positive experience.,I finished TAing a class over the summer at my school. The students were over-the-top appreciative of me and made me feel noticed in multiple ways.,21.0

Not only did God help us overcome a number of financial obstacles we experienced in purchasing the house, but God went even further and provided new furniture.   When we started looking for homes, everything was out of our price range.  The only thing we could afford were condominiums.   But we wanted a yard for our dogs, so that meant we needed a house with a yard.  We were getting a little depressed about our lack of options, but things soon changed.  We decided to go to a gospel retreat to lift our spirits.  While there, one of the ministers told us about this developer who had one home left in a new subdivision.  So, we immediately contacted the developer.  He told us that he would reduce the price of the home if we closed right away.  We had advance loan approval from our bank, but still needed another $10,000 for the down payment.  As it turned out, there was a charity raffle at the retreat and God intervened and made sure we won the prize, which was exactly what we needed--$10,000. So we had our financing in place and then came the free furniture!  We were in desperate need of furniture, but used every penny we had for the down payment.  Fortunately for us, the home we bought was the model home for the new subdivision.  Since we needed furniture, God moved the developer to throw in all the new display furniture for free.  God is good!",On Sept. 6 we closed on our new house. It was great because God did a series of miracles and even provided new furniture.,42.0

I know that when I say this, it sounds like I'm preparing to talk about how wonderful and perfect the day was, but it turned out to be quite the opposite experience. This was the first birthday I ever had that almost no one remembered. I know that I'm mostly to blame for this. I don't like being the center of attention, so I make sure to take my birthday reminder off of Facebook and I definitely don't mention that my birthday is coming up to friends or family. I guess I took it for granted that most people I cared about just happened to keep it locked away and ready for use when it came up every year. I think it also doesn't help that I'm not a kid anymore. Anyway, this year no one really remembered except for my girlfriend and my mom. It's easy for my girlfriend since her mom and I share the same birthday, and my mom had the traumatic experience of giving birth to me so she probably couldn't forget it even if she wanted to. I have to admit that I was disappointed to learn that neither my brothers or my closest friends hadn't remembered on their own. It stung deeply as the day came to a close, the little hope I had dwindling as time ticked on. As time has passed I've realized that it wasn't so bad. I spent the evening with my mom and had dinner with her at a restaurant (her treat, of course). We spent the time enjoying each others company and simply talking. I know it sounds typical and boring, but I treasure that memory now. I spent my birthday celebrating it with the one person who probably cares the most about that day. I was able to share at least one of my birthdays with only one other person and it made it all the more special to me and them. So, that's pretty much it.

I had Mturk and Web development as my main hustle pending the time I get enough money to go for my Masters. Exxon Mobil had an opening some 8 months ago. I applied just like everyone even though my plan was to get a job after my masters. During the application process, I was asked to write a motivation letter. It was through the writing that I changed my mind that I didn't even have to wait to have a Master's degree before I land my dream job. I wrote the letter to the best of my ability highlighting how I want to change the world by working for Exxon Mobil. Luckily for me, I was invited for the next stage of the interview process; an aptitude test. I aced that easily as it was something I loved practicing on when I am less busy. About 2 weeks later, I was invited for a further interview. At this stage, it was getting serious and I really didn't want to lose this one. I put in my very best in the oral and technical session of the interview. It came in like a bomb when 4 months ago, I heard a ping on my laptop. It was a mail!!! I checked it and boom, it was from Exxon Mobil. They invited me for a negotiation. That same week, I was handed my appointment letter and I was given some huge sum of money even before I started work with them. I relocated as my work location is not in my state.

They can smell the food and stick their heads right into tents!  We were sure to put our food in the bear-proof containers provided at the campsite.  But we actually saw some grizzlies visiting the stream when we were fishing.  The salmon were running and the grizzlies rely on these fish to fatten up in order to survive the on-coming winter.  There were several females with cubs who were stationed along the waterfall, catching the salmon that were jumping.  They would pull off some of the skin and nudge it towards the cubs.  They seemed to waste a lot of the fish as they were eating the eggs, the skin and the heads.  I guess they were more interested in the high-calorie parts, which makes sense, considering that they are trying to fatten up.

This was on a small residential road near our house where the speed limit is only 35 miles per hour. As we were stopped at a stop sign, a car unexpectedly slammed into the back of our car. I was shocked and turned to be sure my daughter was okay when out of the corner of my eye, I saw the other car backing away from our car and then speeding off down the road! I was too surprised to make note of many details of the car, and certainly not make note of the license plate or any very identifying information.

I remember thinking what a waste of my vacation days since I could not even do anything fun with my time off. Even though he wasn't home with me during the days I missed, my significant other played a key role in me getting better. He came right home after work and did not go out with friends or run any errands. He must have sensed my surprise since I kept asking him why he was so attentive. I was not expecting a response from him, but was surprised when he responded. He admitted to me that he felt a need to be more attentive and decided it was best if he was home to take care of me. It was a nice surprise to hear and made me feel even more at ease knowing he was doing it because he wanted to and not because he felt forced. The best part of the whole thing is when he made me soup and dinner. It was nice being taken care of for once and not being depended on to do everything. I think he also understood it as well. He commented to me afterward how much work it is to take care of others and how time consuming it can be. If anything I think it made him appreciate me more and also appreciate how being in a relationship is a two way road. Though it would have been nicer being taken care of on a normal day without being sick, I will take what I can get. If being sick was the catalyst for things getting better between me and him, then I am ok with that.",I was not feeling well. My significant other was especially nice to me this time.

I hadnt seen Candace since high school. well turns out she married the high school quarter back, and then they got divorced because he was seeing a girl on the side. I was very surprised to hear about that considering they were like the dream couple in High School. All in all, it was a beautiful ceremony and I was very glad to have went.

I had made strong friendships with many of my coworkers. I was happy there, I was safe there. I had a great deal of job security. I was making decent money for the job I was doing. The only thing was that I wanted more. I wanted power, I wanted responsibility, I needed more. Fairfield properties couldn't offer that to me no matter how hard I worked. There was absolutely no room for advancement in that company. I had to make a really tough decision. Should I quit my safe and comfortable job and take the chance of finding a new job that I hated?

Dr. Spiro needed his new officejet printer set up and I did the physical transportation and connection at his office before lunch. I logged in through our portal after hours to make sure it is visible on the network, but I already could see locally that everything seemed OK. I closed out a handful of open tickets and assigned my billable hours and all that jazz, but since everyone knew I was leaving for greener pastures I didn't have any new work assigned. That gave me a chance to start packing up my various gear and documents and software, but it took  another trip to pick up my monitor and tower.

I hope Doug manages to do alright with his physical therapy, I saw him around town the other day from my car but couldn't stop to chat. That job was a good start to my working life, but ultimately both I and the boss knew I wasn't destined to remain there forever and it wasn't exactly headed in the direction I wanted to pursue. I'm ready to actually put my degree to some use now, and it will be refreshing to be rewarded and invested in a career direction I'm passionate about. I know I won't miss that blasted commute; it's hard to believe I drove that far every day considering how little I really wanted to be there.

3907X2AHF1RP2Z23ZLITZGTDSNU2PB,"Two months ago I did it; I accomplished one of the hardest things I've ever attempted in my life. Last year I volunteered helping out for the marathon that runs through our city. Watching those runners, I felt inspired. I listened to their stories, and saw the sheer joy on their faces, despite the times they came in or how much their body hurt after. I thought to myself, I want to experience this first hand. However, I knew I'd have a ton of training to do because I hadn't run long distance in twenty years. I trained all year, even through the blistering cold of winter. I was determined and it was extremely difficult to stick with it, but I did manage to get into good enough shape to enter and complete the marathon. I can't say how many times I thought about quitting while I was in the marathon because I lost count. I reminded myself that I had gone all year training and never quit. I reminded myself that I had already did a practice run and did fairly well, without quitting. I knew I had prepared, and hydrated and gave my body its needed nutrition and rest. I was prepared, and there was no need to quit. I reminded myself how great it would feel to cross that finish line. Much to my surprise and my delight, I came in eighth place.","After volunteering at a marathon I decided to run that same marathon the next year.

The auditorium was crowded, and my husband and I decided to grab some drinks because it was so hot. The first artist began their performance, and as my husband was paying for our drinks we heard loud pops, followed by screaming. The entire auditorium was frantically rushing to exits, people were dropping down to the ground, some people were trampled over. My husband yanked my arm, signaling to exit behind one of the vendor only access doors. Thankfully, an employee of the auditorium held the door over waved us over to flee. I never turned back because the screams were deafening and the sounds of gunfire rang in multiple places, so I knew there was more than one gunman. We quickly raced down a back hall and exited through a service door. The rush of fresh air whipped through my hair and I saw police vehicles approaching the building. We were flagged over by a police officer to run to an open field adjacent to the venue, and I balled like a baby. We waited for about 20 minutes in the field waiting for the shooters to be found. And then we were told the we could leave. Around 700 people were inside the auditorium, and only around 300 people were left standing in the field.

He always worked and saved and gave everything to me an my mom. We never wanted for anything because of him and his sacrifices. But we always knew his longing to go see his favorite band.

Three dogs came running from out of nowhere, snarling and growling like they wanted to eat me up.  I tried to ignore them, kept my eyes forward, and walked faster, but they kept coming toward me.  I tried yelling at them, but that didn't faze them either.  Then I tried kind of stamping my foot while yelling.  I'm sure I looked really silly, but I didn't want to stop! They looked really aggressive, and they were big dogs.  I walked faster and started looking around to see if I could tell which house they came from.  I was really hoping their owner would come out and call them off.  Whenever I've encountered dogs before, they usually leave me alone when they realize I've passed their house and don't intend to hurt them.  These dogs, however weren't backing off.  I increased my pace again, but I could tell they were right behind me.  I was starting to panic!  I didn't really want to break into a run, because I figured that would just let the dogs know how afraid I was starting to feel, but I really didn't think I had much choice.  So, I started to run. One of them nipped at the back of my leg, but he didn't really hurt me, thank goodness.  I turned the corner at the end of the street and ran into a gas station that was there.  Thankfully, the dogs quickly lost interest and went back toward the direction they had come from.

There's no guarantees. And honestly, it just started to feel like it was about being boxed into any kind of box that allowed them prescribed medication they were enticed to sell. Anyway, meeting her was awesome, immediately we got down to the facts, I have these headaches. They come and are debilitating, but migraine medication doesn't work. It starts out in my neck, goes into my head and just sits there for days on end. She asked about how I spent my days, how I spend a lot of time working at the computer. She asked about my eyes, wearing glasses, all of that. She just seemed to know exactly how to get where she was going. And I even admitted to her how I just didn't believe anything would work out. She pulled up some information on the computer and explained how my headaches were probably related to my eyes. And that back pain was causing neck pain and so on. I couldn't believe what she knew about this given she was a general practitioner not a specialist. Just like that, she said it wasn't migraines and previous treatments were all wrong, and missteps for my treatment. So fast forward a couple weeks, a visit to the optometrist and now I haven't had a headache or stuffy head or pain in my neck since these visits. I am so thrilled and happy.

Since we became so close so fast, I am starting to wonder what life would have been like if we had never stopped talking and being friends in the first place.

I felt like my world was coming down and there was nothing I could do, I am suppose to be her guardian and protector of all things and now I have to wait and sit on my hands until further notice. So for the next several months we kept going to the doctor and he would run his test to see if she was strong enough yet. The day before her 1st birthday we got the clear. She was strong enough!!!! Again so many emotions flooded through me. We already had a big birthday planned for the next day to celebrate with family and friends. I announced the next day our big news that she was strong enough now. We has such a wonderful day that day and she was showered with love and joy and prayer to keep her safe on the operating table. Then last week came and went so quickly. We arrived early in the morning and checked in. I gave my sweet beautiful girl all my love. Then we waited what seemed like hours and hours of sheer terror and boredom and hope all mixed into one bag. Noon rolled around and the nurse at the front desk encouraged us to eat something, so we did. When we came back the surgeon was also entering the waiting room looking for us. The moment I saw his face my heart sank. He came over held our hands and cried. I know at that moment she didn't make it. Now here I am in therapy and I have to write everything down in this stupid diary. I don't see how this is going to help.

It's hard for me to set up plans because as someone with anxiety, it's a lot of information that is thrown at me at once. My family also isn't the easiest to get along with, so that was a wrench also when it came to setting things up. But now, I had time. I met them where they lived at. It took a while to get passed the initial awkwardness, and to be honest I still felt that for a while. My mind kept telling me to run and to fight another day. But I was determined to see it through.

I was lucky he lived so long, but still. 15 years is so short. Why do they only live so little? We deserve more time with them right? They deserve longer lives, but that's not what they get. I'm glad for the time I had with him. He made me really happy. During the times that I struggled the most at school and home, he was there. He always climbed up in bed to comfort me when I would cry. He would jump on the side of the bed to wake me up and then pull me outside once I got the leash on him. He always wanted to go for walks and play. I loved that dog. He was my first dog. I chose him myself. I also named him. At least he died of old age. At least we didn't have to put him down. I'm going to miss him. He was such a good boy.","My dog passed away recently.

On the flight we got bumped to business class, which was wonderful since it was a pretty long flight. The resort was incredibly classy, and all inclusive. We spent the week basking in the sun and drinking fancy cocktails. I think my favorite part was just how much space we had to ourselves; there were barely any other guests. Every night they had a different show. We agree that our favorite was when there was stand-up comedy. Sadly after the week was up we had to fly home.

I think that it would be fair to say that he is the glue that holds this family together. I am so glad that way back in 2011, I agreed to be his girlfriend. That was one of the best decisions I have ever made. 2019 was a rather rough year for us though. It tested us in ways that I never thought would be possible. About six months ago, I was laid off from my current job due to ""budget cuts."" The lay off came out of nowhere and I was under the impression that I was secure in my job. I was devastated about it and it sent me into a depression over the following weeks. The depression continues to get worse because I was struggling to find another job. It got so bad, to the point where I wouldn't even get out of bed some days. I was a mess. Nothing was getting done around the house and the clutter was just making me feel worse about the entire situation. My husband quickly noticed. Normally, he is this stone cold guy, who rarely shows affection or his emotion. However, over this course of that week, my husband pulled out all the stops to get me out of my funk. He would come home from work and draw me a bubble bath and immediately begin dinner. There were even a few occasions that week where he would bring home flowers and a nice card for no reason at all. He left me sticky notes with little affirmations about how much he loved me and how amazing I was all over the house. He even did the dishes a few times, the right way. Not once did he make me feel bad about not being able to find a new job after the layoff. I knew he was stressing out about it, but he never let on that he was stressed at all.

We took the tour bus around the city and viewed many famous settings. I was very impressed by the design of the old and the new buildings I viewed while on the ride. We had a fantastic guide who not only gave history on all of the things pointed out, but he also suggested other places to go to see many more historic items. I was very impressed looking at Big Ben and the square surrounding the area. After seeing Big Ben in person, I could easily see why it was called Big Ben. We were fortunate enough to be in the open top portion of the tour bus so we had many unrestricted views. I really loved seeing all of the beauty of Buckingham Palace. It was not only large, but it fit so well with many of the other structures in the area. Sure looked like someone knew what they were doing when it was constructed. We decided it would be a great thing to do to go on the London Eye . We were not wrong as the view of the city from the top of the Eye was just spectacular. I could have stayed on the Eye for many, many hours. Another of the interesting things to see was the Tower Bridge. I found it very interesting to see the steam engines that were used to raise the bridge. The final stop on our time in England was our visit to Stonehenge in Avebury Plain.

Its not that I didn't have fun on my birthday's, but it was just getting kind of old, like me. I was hoping my friends would offer to do something this time, and they did. One of them suggested we go to Universal Studios. This was definitely more than I was thinking of. I was hoping we'd just do something close to home, just not at a family members's house. I had never even been out of the state since I was a kid, so this was going to be a big occasion. We booked out flights and went about a week later. I hated the plane ride, but the fun time we had there made up for it. We ate so much overpriced food, went on rides, went sight seeing at areas around the place, and just had a blast. I'm not a fan of Harry Potter, but my friends are, so they suggested we go to the Harry Potter restaurant. Since food was involved, I was down for it. It wasn't great, but I did recognize some of what I saw there, which made it somewhat better. It would have been cooler had I actually been a fan. After a few days there, we all went back home and went on with our lives. I had such a good time.","It was my birthday last month, and I had the most memorial moment in my life.

A bad person?? Okay, let me start over from the beginning. A week ago, last Monday, my little baby boy (not so little anymore!) Henry got on the big yellow school bus for the first time ever and headed off to his very first day of Kindergarten. As I watched him go, I felt a weird mixture of feelings, one of which was relief. Relief??? I'm not supposed to feel relief!!! I'm supposed to be heartbroken and nostalgic, thinking how different things will be without him around the house. Looking at his little un-played-with toys. Missing his voice and constant questions. Thumbing through old photo albums and marveling at how it was practically just yesterday that he was taking his first steps and saying his first words. Now I'm not saying that I didn't have those feelings, of course I did. I mean, I'm not a complete psychopath. But shouldn't that be the end of the story? Am I terrible for being a little bit glad that I'm going to have a few question-free hours to breathe and decompress? Is this normal? Am I selfish? Is this a sign of a bad mother? Ugh. Nobody told me that motherhood was going to have THIS many worries in it.","My oldest son, Henry, started Kindergarten today.

I went with my boyfriend. My favorite site to see was Buckingham Palace. I am a huge fan of the royals so this was quite exciting for me. The English countryside was so charming that it made me wish I could just move there. Madame Tussauds was very interesting. I wanted to stay there forever. Riding the London Eye was quite thrilling. I took so many pictures that I had to download them every night to make room on the camera for the next day. I had always imagined the English people as being kind of stuck up. I was quite surprised that our experiences were the opposite of that. Everyone was warm and friendly. I saw one section of London that reminded of a scene out of the movie Mary Poppins.

Our venue was on a winery in Napa Valley, California and we had guests come from all over. It honestly felt like a fairy tale. We had twinkle lights set up everywhere and our ceremony overlooked the gorgeous property during sunset. I am going to be honest, my wife did most of the planning. I feel like that is always how it goes. But I said I wanted a live band. We got a bluegrass group to play and everyone really enjoyed dancing to the music. It is funny how most of the planning lands on the woman. The night is really about the bride. I kind of feel I just need to show up and have a good time. She was so worried about what she looked like and I tried to tell her she was beautiful no matter what, but of course she never believes that. She had a great time too though, I just think there was more stress for her leading up to the wedding than for me. All the wine we drank was from the winery we were at and it was great! My wife has great taste and everyone let her know she did a wonderful job- as did I choosing her. I can't believe it has only been a year since the wedding. Time has flown by.

I can't believe it finally happened! It's the cutest little one bedroom flat, overlooking downtown too! It has this perfect little breakfast nook tucked behind the kitchen that's perfect for reading, or now writing in this. I think it'll be the perfect little spot to do homework in the evenings. I've been doing some shopping for decorations and things, and I think I'm leaning mostly towards teal and pink, maybe some gold. A girl has to have some glitter in her life. I have the best balcony, so I'm waiting for dad to build me a flower box to put out there. I bought some begonias, so for now they're just soaking up the sunshine out there. I found some cute canvases, so maybe I'll try my hand at some oil painting and spruce it up some more. The grocery store is just right around the corner, but carrying all the groceries up eight flights of stairs is starting to annoy me. Maybe I should buy less at a time. The one thing I miss about being at home, is mom doing my laundry for me. I never realized how much I despise doing my own laundry. I can't do much at a time either because carrying them up and down the stairs is a pain. Maybe I should find a laundry service near me.

I narrowed it down to a few places. My one friend is vegan ,so I had to find somewhere with options for her. Another friend is lactose intolerant, so that meant in Italian food. After taking everyones diet into account I found the perfect restaurant. It was a modern place with lots of dairy free and meat free options. WHen I asked everyone they agreed that was a good place. The night we were supposed to meet I had trouble finding something to wear. I thought I had the perfect dress. When I went to put it on I found out it didn't fit any longer. I started to panic. I didn't have a backup outfit. I eventually settled on dressy jeans and a top, but I felt under dressed. Despite the chaos the dinner was fun. Everyone had a great time.

It was an important event for me, and I had to do a lot of preparation. First off, I had to find the venue. I looked all over town for various options, and made a list of the best choices. Then, our group voted on which restaurant to choose. We ended up choosing Anju, a new Korean place which had rave reviews. Next, I locked down the reservations, and made sure everybody knew when it was happening. However, we made sure to keep it a secret from Pablo, in hopes of surprising him. Once the night of the dinner arrived, I went over to Pablo's apartment to pick him up. He was a bit confused on what we were doing, but I told him we would go grab a slice of pizza or something. As we arrived at the Korean restaurant, Pablo begin to suspect that something was up. As soon as he seen all of our friends waiting outside, he knew he had been surprised. Everybody jumped out and yelled ""surprise"" in unison. It was really well done, and Pablo was laughing so hard he began to cry. We filed into the restaurant, and began our meal. We had a lot of laughs, told a lot of stories, and ate our fair share of delicious Korean cuisine. As we finished our main course, the staff came out with another surprise - a large chocolate cake, with ""goodbye Pablo"" spelled out in white icing. It looked amazing! Afterwards, I learned that our friend Javiar had set this up. What a fantastic way to end the meal.

She makes eye contact with us when called and not called upon. And she appears to be a normal healthy child, however she has yet to learn to crawl. That was until today. We were all watching TV and playing games with our son. We try to include our daughter in on everything since she loves to play. Our son was playing legos and my daughter was playing with a ball game where it goes down a spiral slide. Well, the ball got away from her when it got to the bottom and instead of crying like she has done in the past, she flopped over on her stomach and crawled to the ball. This was the first time she has ever initiated crawling and going out of her way to get something on her own without crying for it.

All of a sudden we see the ball go rolling, her crawling after it, and next thing you know, shes next to the both of us waiting for us to play with her. It was a proud day in our family.

Coming from the family that she did, it's a wonder. She was the family punching bag. Whenever something went wrong, it was Katie's fault. It didn't matter who did it, how it happened, the fact that Katie was in another state at the time -- the entire family, including her two sisters, would gang up and yell at her. So Katie's sister, Krystal, is getting married into a conservative Greek Orthodox family. She's losing her mind because she wants so bad for her new family to think she's perfect, which is laughable, but whatever. Of course, the morning of the wedding, everything is going wrong and how dare Katie do this, despite the fact that Katie wasn't even awake when everything started happening. Makeup if misplaced, boxes haven't been taken up to the church for decorating, the works. So they all load up and head to the church to get the place ready. Katie grabs a box nearly as big as her hauls it into the church, and asks Krystal where it needs to go, to which she responds, ""OH MY GOD KATIE JUST SET IT DOWN SOMEWHERE!""Katie, being the sweetheart she is, sets it down somewhere out of the way so people won't trip on it, but still in a higher traffic area so it can be found. She goes to put on her dress because some of the groomsmen are putting up the decorations.

Not only was it not in the refrigerator, but Katie cleary hid it so nobody else could find it because she was trying to ruin the wedding. Katie apologizes and shows her where the box is. Katie will hold Krystal's bouquet (the other sister couldn't do it for whatever reason -- it was probably too heavy for her poor, dainty arms). So Katie verifies how that's going to work. ""So you give it to me, there's some talking, you and Carl walk around the altar a few times, then I give it back to you?"" Krystal doesn't answer, and after a few more questions, she dismissively says, ""yeah, yeah, you give it back to me.""During the ceremony, Krystal never makes a move to take the bouquet back, and does not accept it when offered.

About six months ago my family of seven did the unthinkable: we moved more than 1,000 miles north to an area we didn't know much about.

Even though that meant going to new schools and losing friends for my siblings and I, we knew our family needed our dad to take this job. The move itself was pretty crazy, since we needed five large moving trucks to haul our things. We had one truck that was nothing more than our beds and bed frames. Another truck seemingly held all of our clothes, which was very eye opening. We have a lot of clothes! After finally getting settled in however, we really began to love our new surroundings. Moving from the city to a more rural area was perfect for my brothers and sisters and I. We finally had room to play sports and do all sorts of activities outside. Growing up in a downtown situation made it hard for us to experience this type of freedom, and we relished in it right away.

Though it was only March, it was already starting to get hot there so we found refuge in one of the hotels - I think it was the Mirage? - and what an amazing sight it was! There were statues everywhere, the ceiling was decorated and it had a huge mall that we strolled around in. Later on, we went and saw the famous Bellagio fountains and what a wonder they are, with light shows and music. I had heard about them many times but seeing them in person was a true wonder.

Once we found a place that wasn't too crowded we went inside and sat down at a booth and only after I sat down did I realize just how tired I was.  I was just sitting there looking all around when I turn to look at my husband and he is holding out a small box on the table in front of me. He says, this is for you. Happy Birthday. In all the excitement I had forgotten it was my birthday, and reached over and took the box. I had no idea what this could be. I opened the box and see that it is a necklace that is a replica of Episode 8!!  Wow!!! I could not believe this! What a perfect day this was turning out to be and what a wonderful surprise this necklace was from my husband!","My husband took me to the new Star Wars land, which really excited me.

On my birthday this year, my husband bought me tickets for the two of us to go see them in concert. To top it all off, he bought us front row seats! My excitement was overflowing and I could not wait until the concert date.  My husband did not think he would have a very good time seeing an old boy band, but he was wrong. The day finally came for the concert and we made the hour long drive into the city. The whole way there I blasted NKOTB songs through our car stereo. When we got to the venue I could barely contain myself, I cried tears of joy as we parked. This was it! We made our way in and the energy was so uplifting throughout the concourses in the venue. First stop, a concert tshirt. My husband was still trying to act like cool, like he was just tolerating this for my enjoyment. We entered the arena and were ushered all the way to the front to our seats. I couldn't help but turn around in circles looking at how big this place was. All of the seats would be filled soon, but I was up front! My husband started to smile as he saw my joy. The lights dimmed and a wave of screams erupted as music began to play. In a flash of lights NKOTB took the stage. I felt like a young teen again! My husband laughed and smiled as he saw me jump up and down with overflowing excitement.

After not talking for 20 years there was plenty to talk about. In all the talking I learned we both were divorced. Still single even. Which is nice. Allows us both to talk about whatever we want without worries. Some partners get jealous when talking to ex's. So it was a great conversation. Hope to do it again soon. So I offered up my number hoping she would give me a call back. She agreed she would. Even said she had a good time. So there is hope that she will. Could be a lot of fun.

First, we visited the shire, they wouldn't let us into the hobbit houses, but that's okay. Just getting to be there, surrounded by the mountains and scenery and sets from the movies was probably the best thing i'll ever experience. I can't believe how well they've maintained the sets in the almost two decades since the movie came out. Everything was so green and vibrant, we had so much fun. After going to the LoTR park, we got to see Flight of the Conchords! I can't believe they were in town, and the tickets ate up a bunch of my budget, but I don't care.

3WEV0KO0ONE9I1GBOR64Q4PT1N1SD6,"I've heard people say before that life is a journey. What they don't say is what type of journey it really is. When I first married Rod almost 22 years ago, I had no idea what I was in store for. Sure, I knew I'd be moving in with someone for the first time, so I'd lost some of my autonomy. We'd argued before, and I knew we'd argue again in the future. The wedding vows confirmed that we were joined together for richer or poorer. No matter how high we went, we'd be together. But I had no idea just how high or low those things would take us. For our 22nd anniversary yesterday, Rod surprised me with a series of trips that illustrated just how we've gone on that journey together. We first went out on a boat to symbolize the start of our journey: setting sail. After we'd sailed out far enough, we jumped in the water and started to swim around. That was to represent when, early in our marriage, I miscarried, and we realized that things wouldn't always be so easy. There were times we'd have to swim together ourselves, doing the hard work ourselves. After we'd tired ourselves out, we hopped back on the boat and had a picnic. This one was to remember that whenever we're taxed for events like that, we'll always have the fruit of our marriage to nourish and sustain us. We had a lot of fruit on the way back, actually. And then he finished up with something I couldn't have imagined: a hot air balloon ride at sunset with champagne and all. It was in recognition of our commitment - no, our promise - to sail off into the sunset together. It's going to be a good life, another good 22 years...just as it always has with him.","My husband surprised me with a wonderful day out for our 22nd wedding anniversary.

I remember sitting in the hospital on my birthday hoping he would wake up, that is the only present I wanted. I didnt feel like celebrating or doing gifts, I just wanted to see my dad. Unfortunately 10 days after the accident he passed away. I didn't know what to do or how to take it. I knew he was still heavily involved in the church and this brought me some soalce. I attended but didnt really know all the rules and stipulations of this church.

I asked if I could get these garments somewhere and he told me of a store downtown.

I met Ted about 4 months ago, I was sure he'd reject my offer, but now that I have the money from the bank loan, I'm planning on sending him the payment tomorrow. Well, let me go back a bit, it's been about 6 months since I've written anything and I didn't want to write about the disappointment of not getting the car, so I'll start with the craigslist ad. I've had some money set aside for some time now, and thought that it might be a fun project to get an older car and fix it up on the side. So, I checked out craigslist and found this camaro with a beautiful body, but it needed a bit of engine work. The funny thing is, it didn't really have high miles, it just sat in someone's garage for a long time. Ted was the man who posted the listing, so I contacted him and set up a date to check out the car. He wasn't able to meet me that day, but told me to meet him the next day at his mom's house. Apparently, the car was Ted's dad's car and when his dad passed away, his mom couldn't get rid of it. But she also couldn't bear to drive it either so it sat neglected for nearly 40 years without anyone even turning it on. So, when I met Ted, the car was pushed out into the driveway, and it was amazing. It was in pristine condition other than the engine neglect, so I made my offer. Ted said he couldn't go any lower than $15k though and I only had about $9000 in my account. I ended up meeting with a bank to take out a small loan for the remaining amount but only offered him $12k. He agreed and we went down to the notary to sign the paperwork. I had a towing company bring it to my house, and pushed it into the garage to start working on it. The car still needs a bit of work, but it'll be a really fun project so I'm looking forward to learning something new.

3WAKVUDHUX29G575MJYI5DXL09IU7U,"Three years ago my wife and I decided that it was time for us to permanently separate, and to file for a divorce. It was a hard decision to make for the both of us. Initially we decided to come upon an agreement on who would have our children during the school week, weekends, and holidays. This is something we were not able to agree upon, and we knew that we both needed a lawyer. I had a feeling that this was going to be a nasty battle between us. Unfortunately, I was correct, the battle ended up being drawn out for three years. By this time the kids actually became of legal age to decide where they wanted to stay. To my surprise our children decided that they wanted to stay with me. Come to find out their mother had started seeing another mate who were abusive towards my Ex and our children. He had a drinking problem, and became violent when he drank. Our children have fond memories of when me and my Ex were together, and knew what a normal household would run like. The case was drawn out over the three years due to lack of proof showing that my Ex was an unfit mother and having an unstable household for our children to reside full time in. During those three years I worked on purchasing a home, and I thought it was necessary to remain single during this time. I felt my children did not need their dad to get into a relationship whenever they already had enough stress on their shoulders. I remember the day like yesterday whenever we were at court, and it was proved that my Ex was not only an unfit mother, but was unable to provide a stable home environment. Also, on top of everything our children each confessed to the courtroom how they prefer to reside in my home due to the hostile environment that they were encountering between my Ex and her new mate. They confessed how this was affecting them in school as well with their social lives.

It is a pretty mild form but still trips me up in public where I get immense stage fright like symptoms even in a one on one situation. This led me to start working on my book ""The R Word"". The book is about my experience being a functioning autistic individual but trapped in my own mind and body when in social situations which makes me seem for lack of a better term, retarded. The book talks about overcoming these challenges and how I hope to grow and think I haven grown. After much deliberation I decided to leap off the edge and host a book launch in celebration of its release. I remember the day vividly, the sun was shining even though it was mid october in the pacific northwest. I wore my best shirt, and had about 4 dozen copies of my book. Many people came in and bought a copy and I was doing pretty well with engagement. I shook some hands and even hugged a few people that I hadnt seen in years.

I distinctly remember this man, he came in to the store and tipped his hat and smiled at me, and I had seen him before several times. There was nothing out of the ordinary at all, except he did dress as though it were still the 1950s. I interacted a few times with the man, as he had several questions about products on the floor and generally probing for the best product for his house (I can't recall exactly). He enjoyed asking me questions, and always struck up good conversation when he came in. As I was helping this gentlemen find what he was looking for, a woman a few aisles over made a distinct shriek that can only be described as a horrible gasp for help. The man dropped the product he was holding and ran to find out what was going on. I had to follow. I ran several aisles down, and the man was overtop of the woman, stabilizing telling people to call 911. I called the ambulance while the man performed some chest compressions and was directing other store employees to help him in any way they could. The man completely took over, and when the ambulance came, the swiftly took her away. The man left quickly afterward, seemingly exhausted, but the police that stayed after to file a report told me that the EMTs notified them that the woman was stable and that the man's actions may have saved her life, at least for now. Well, today, the exact woman came today and I recognized her instantly. She was looking for information on the man who saved her life, and I felt a great deal of sadness in telling her I did not know who he was. She left looking a bit dejected, and I felt for her, as this man was the window between life and death for her, and he was gone as quickly as he came.

3OF2M9AATHAEXJ8ZB0MZQAHM9YOKZH,"I've got mixed feelings about work lately, and I'm still trying to process the last few months. Around three months or so ago I talked with my supervisor about possibly advancing through the ranks. I mean, I've been with the company about two years now and it's somewhat strange working with people fresh out of college. Anyway, he was totally on board with that and hinted at an opening in management that would make me a team supervisor, but it wasn't really up to him (it's the coordinator's job to pick and choose promotions). So I shrugged and tried to win the part. I came in early every day, helped answer questions from the new people in the office, and even took on that extra project from the finance department. Of course, three months later that opening gets taken by some new hire. I was feeling pretty dejected but apparently the coordinator took notice of my efforts and actually gave me a small raise. That was a nice incentive, and plus I can add some finance related stuff and other employable skills to my resume. I guess all in all I'm not even sure if I would have liked the management position anyways, and it's got me wondering if maybe I should take what experience I have from this position and move on. The pay is good, about decent for a data scientist, but I'd really enjoy taking on some more long term projects or having a leadership position. Working here was invaluable as someone new to the industry and trying to learn the ropes, but if there's no hope of working my way through the ranks, then it's probably best if I part ways. I'm a little stung about the promotion, but honestly I'm not upset about it anymore. The raise was at least something, and I'm thinking with the experience I got from the finance project that I can look into a job at a bank corporation that reached out to me. It would be a smaller office and more tight knit environment, which I think I'd prefer more. Still, I wonder if I should just hold out and wait to see if I can perhaps grab another position onboard management. It's a lot to consider, but I'm sure it will all work out.",Put myself in a position to get promoted within my company.

And it was random, they chose solely based on superfician circumstances whether or not to kill someone--if they didnt have a reason, they'd make one up. However, my mother was particularly afraid. She had no one to protect her. Her father was an abusive man, not afraid to beat his children at any moment for any reason. He was a monster. I had never met him, for obvious reasons.

He didn't care what happened to her, and she was in fear everyday that one day she would be killed, and she had no one to defend her. Her mother couldn't do anything, she was weak and sickly.

It all started when I realized that I needed to get my pickup registration taken care of, but was really lazy about going about it. This was all because I needed this to go through so it would pass a required fuel emissions test that was mandatory at my job. If I didn't do this, it could lead to much larger problems, which is something I didn't need. After some time, I realized I had only one day left to get it done! The problem was, I was very busy the next couple days with my family engagements. I was in some serious trouble and really needed to figure out a solution quickly! The few things I had to do at home included cooking for my family and also doing some morning chores. Both would take a significant amount of time alone. Then, like a ray of light, a miracle happened. I was in the middle of being with family when one of my brothers offered to take care of the tasks that I was assigned (i.e. cooking for the family).

Instead of going to get my pickup truck registration renewed on time or, heaven forbid, early, I dawdled around until the last minute and then managed to FORGET the deadline entirely! End result: my sad truck failed to pass the required emissions test. No big deal, right? Not unless I want to drive the truck anywhere. So now I found myself scrambling trying to find some kind of ""fix this mess"" workaround all the while mentally kicking myself for being such a slacker in the first place. After about 50 phones calls to every friend and FOF (friend of friend) in very high (and a few low) places, I learned quite a lot about emission testing. For starters, new catalytic converters are crazy expensive. Second, you can hack almost anything with the right know-how and equipment ( which almost always includes aluminum foil). It pays to have friends who know stuff. They don't go out of their way to tell you but if you fail, you get one do-over, for FREE! Provided you can find a repair shop that offers one. That involves looking for a teeny-tiny official-looking sticker in the corner of an often very dirty window. So once you find this mechanical get-out-of jail-free card, you still have to pass the test. That's where friends who know stuff come in. The same three things kept coming up:  tires, oil, cold air. That's the ingredients to the motoring magic elixir: Make sure you have your tires at the proper pressure: make sure you have fresh, clean oil: go when they first open so your car is warm and the air temperature is cooler. The hotter the day, the more chance of coughing out some of the bad stuff. Armed with my new oil and freshly-fluffed tires, I was waiting at the bay door when the service center opened for the day. Fifteen easy-peasy minutes later I was motoring on my way to the license bureau with my A-plus grade emission sticker in hand.

Upon arrival at the trail head the weather was perfect and we set off gear in tow. Now I like to be overly prepared and have high aspirations when I do anything, so we had too much gear for the both of us and wanted to go much farther then we actually did. After the first 3 hours of of hiking we were spent. However I had originally wanted to get another 5 miles before camping. Along the way we crossed paths with group of people and they had suggested veering off trial to visit a waterfall. Adn it turns out we weren't that far. So we decided to drop our bags and scout it out. While off trail we witnessed one of the neatest things, a doe giving birth. At first we heard some strange sound, I never heard a deer holler but this one certainly was making some kind of noise. As we got a bit closer we spotted her lying down making some kind of racket. We thought it must be injured. Deer usually have ticks and fleas so we decided it best to leave it alone. and continue on to the waterfall. Once we spotted the waterfall we were underwhelmed to say the least. More like babbling brook and less like the idyllic waterfall flowing into a mountain pond. so we decided to head back to the gear. As we headed back we saw the same doe, this time wandering around thrashing and acting erratically we thought must really be injured. however it was just a distraction, moments later we saw the cutest tiny little deer stumble out of the bushes.

3Z3ZLGNNSJGZNTZ13YBNIVOGT9DQ3E,"When people think of the scariest day of their life they often think of a near death experience or the loss of a loved one.   For me, it was when my wife started having complications while giving birth.  It all happened about 5 months ago when we were about to welcome the birth of our son.  It started off like we expected: my wife went into labor, we waited until the contractions were getting closer and then we headed for the hospital.  I thought everything seemed like it was going as planned but as I quickly learned, complications can happen suddenly.  As we were walking into the hospital my wife suddenly loss consciousness and I happened to catch her just as she was about to fall to the floor.  As the nurses rushed to her aid I was in shock of what was happening.  This couldn't possibly be normal.  Everything seemed to be in slow motion.  She was put on a stretcher, rushed to a room and I followed behind helplessly and numb from what was happening.  After the doctor arrived and several checks were done he explained that my wife was having some sort of complications, her airflow was being restricted and they needed to do emergency surgery to deliver our baby.  After everything was prepared I was allowed to stay by her side and watch as the doctor started the c-section to deliver our baby.  As he was doing the procedure he noticed what the issue was.  According to him, scar tissue from a previous surgery had attached itself to the underside of one side of her lung and the combination of that and the baby putting pressure on her organs had caused her to lose consciousness.  He said he'd never seen something like that happen but was expecting the pressure to be relieved once his procedure was finished.  Several minutes later I was able to hold our baby for the first time and shortly after that my wife woke from the procedure.  Needless to say I counted my blessings that day and our lives have never been the same.",My wife was about to give a birth to a child but was having complications due to the surgery that she had one and a half  year ago.,150.0

My cousin just cooked the usual hamburgers and hot dogs and as it got close to dinner time they put steaks and chicken on the grill.  My aunt had made macaroni and cheese and salad.  I brought apple pies and chocolate cake. Everyone stayed in the backyard and the kids played in the pool. There ended up being  at least 10 little kids at the party. The adults served the food, cleaned up and caught up on the latest family news. Everyone brought fireworks they had bought to make one big pile.  My brother made a safe area in the backyard to shoot fireworks off at dark.  We actually got started a little early since the kids couldn't wait any longer. My cousins were in charge of lighting most all of the fireworks while we set back and watched the show. I was quite surprised at how many fireworks we had. It seemed like they were shooting off fireworks for hours and it was well after 10 p.m. before some started leaving. The kids were so tired and most of them had fallen asleep.

I'm thrilled that it has gone well for them, I mean the reason they lost their other job was just bogus at least in my opinion. My friend is such a great person, they're a hard worker, they're reliable, and so friendly and cheerful. They didn't deserve the hardship at their last place of employment that they had to cope with and I just hope that this job lives up to everything they thought it would be. It all started three months before when they first got promoted to assistant manager, they were so proud. Suddenly they became ill, they noticed they were going to the bathroom more often with blood, and they just kept feeling weaker. By the end of the month they could barely eat, and they already lost too much weight for such a short period. I remember that they thought they were headed for their death bed that they felt that badly. But they just kept pushing longer hours, more responsibility because after all they had just been freshly promoted. By the end of the month the last day they worked before they finally got a two day weekend they couldn't stand for more then ten minutes at a time without sitting down and their thigh muscles were just burning as they described later on. So after managing to last until the end of the day just barely they decided to go to the ER and when they got there they were told that they just had a bad case of colitis and were given some tyelnol with codine and sent home. Come Monday they called out because they were just in so much pain and felt so horrible. In the middle of the week it finally came to head and they went back to the ER because they just couldn't go to the bathroom anymore. They were admitted and went through a month of hell trying to recover. When they finally got out they were told to not go back to work so they told their job they wouldn't be there for another month per doctors instructions. So after that month passed they finally decided to go back to work and when they got there the people they worked with seemed less than thrilled that they were back. After a week they were called into the back office and told they were being demoted because management didn't feel that they could keep up anymore. Then came the big office theft and they all pointed the finger at my friend even though they had a perfect alibi. When they had nothing else to go on they started messing with my friends schedule and hours to the point that they left them with one or two days a week. It got to the point to where my friend just quit because for whatever reason they turned my friend in to a scapegoat and it wasn't fair in the least so this diary is why I am so glad my friend has been given the chance for a new beginning they deserve it after everything they have been through and what they went through no one deserves but you understand that don't you my papery friend.",Helped a friend to find a job.

A young mother was pushing her stroller and walking her dog, talking in her airpods while her kid was watching an iPad. I noticed that there was a group of skateboarders approaching her from behind. The first skateboarder struck the edge of the stroller, knocking the young mother's iPhone onto the pavement. The skateboarder fell on the ground, and his three friends gathered to see what had happened. The young mother was startled and promptly maced all four of them.

When I started to feel depressed or detached I would consult my virtual playlist of childhood songs and allow myself to drift away and become immersed in the happy feelings that immediately followed. I was shocked at how well it worked and how long the effects lasted. I even went so far as to download the songs and play them when my memory of them would fade. I also use them as ringtones for my close family and friends. This has made a noticeable difference in my mood upon answering their calls. Since I've been using the Disney songs as a therapy of sorts, my friends and family have noticed a change.

On the night of August 3rd, I packed my suitcases for my trip the following day - I was prepared get some peace by venturing back to my hometown: Detroit, Michigan. I woke up at 4:00 AM the following morning, ready to drive down to the airport. I wanted to get there early for my 7:00 AM flight so that I could get through security and have a cup of coffee before I had to jump onto my airplane. Upon my arrival, I did the usual: I checked in my luggage, went through the security checkpoints, and I still had an hour to kill before I had to hop on the plane. I went over to the cafeteria's Starbucks and ordered a tall latte - I was still tired after all, and moderately anxious for my upcoming flight. I sat down at a corner booth, drink in hand, and looked out at the airport's lobby. I saw so many people scattered about, many rushing to the gates so that they don't miss their flights. I knew that I was glad that I left early enough to relax while many others didn't. Enamored by these thoughts, I failed to recognize the gorgeous stranger who sat down at my booth, until I felt a whisper in my ear.""I know who you are and what you've done,"" she said. Shocked, I could only muster, ""what could you possibly mean? I'm only here drinking my coffee before my flight home. I've not done anything wrong.""Smugly, she said ""I never said that you did anything wrong. How presumptuous.

The environment was toxic, and it did not even pay well. I wanted to leave, but the hours were so long and irregular it made looking for a new position difficult. Worst of all, I was lonely.

It had been an easy pregnancy, like my first, and there was no reason to think anything could be wrong. I'd had great prenatal care all the way through the pregnancy and totally trusted my doctors. So when I finally went into labor, I knew I'd be in good hands, and my main concern was meeting our baby daughter (and having the pain of labor and delivery be finished.)  My husband Joe took me to the hospital when the contractions indicated that they really meant business this time. We got there quickly, and within minutes, I was in a very comfortable, well-appointed labor-and-delivery room. My doctor soon showed up and hooked me up to the fetal monitor, which showed things like our little girl's heart rate.   The first sign anything was awry was evidenced by my sweet-natured doctor's expression.  She explained to us that our little girl was showing signs of distress, with a raised heartbeat and other signs.  This meant it was crucially important to deliver our baby quickly, which might necessitate a Caesarean.   However, the labor was progressing along quite quickly, so it was very possible the C-section could be averted.  The doctor and attending nurse monitored me closely, and as soon as I was fully dilated, which happened quickly, I was instructed to push as hard as I possibly could.  After several extremely intense and painful contractions and gut-ripping pushes, our little sweet one, to be named Carla, was out.  But something was very wrong.  While newborns are generally bluish when they are born, Carla was a deep purplish.  After letting us give her a too-brief cuddle, the doctors (now there was another) whisked her away for examination and further testing.  Joe and I were very worried we'd lose her, but the doctors reassured us that we were in the right place, and she would probably be fine. They had dealt with births like this before, they assured us, but we were terrified of losing her.... or something else going wrong...  About 45 minutes later, our doctor stepped back into the room.  Joe and I anxiously waited to hear the news, which was better, but definitely not perfect. Carla, the doctor explained, had been born with a small hole in her heart which caused a heart murmur, an irregular sounding beat.  It would need to be tracked and monitored, and possibly might be treatable when she got older, but for now, we would just watch and wait, and she would be fine.  A little later, our beloved newborn was wheeled back into the room, with a much healthier color.",a scary experience with a baby born with a heart defect .

All my buddies treated me like I was a bomb ready to explode at any moment - it was humiliating and frustrating.  As a matter of fact, even now, I don't keep up with many of them.  My wife and I separated - she was pregnant with our first child at the time - it was gut-wrenching.  As pissed off and non-trusting as I felt, I finally came to realize that my psychiatrist knew what he was doing.  He really made all the chaos and fear in my life make sense to me, and taught me how to compartmentalize things and truly deal with them when the time was right.  Once I learned how to do that, everything fell into place for me.  No longer did I stuff down my feelings and pretend I was some macho tough guy who wasn;t allowed to have emotions like fear, sympathy, and compassion.   In the last month, my wife and our newborn have come home, and we are stronger than ever, I am back on active duty and work, and there have been minimal incidents with the PTSD effecting me so strongly.  While the PTSD really nailed me at the onset, I have walked on and learned to be a better human to myself and the others around me.","Around 5 months ago I was diagnosed with PTSD. As a result, I've had a pretty hard time since the diagnosis. Though it's been tough, I've lost and gained a lot since then.",120.0

But then as we talked more, she was always too busy or had some other excuse to avoid making real plans. After she did so a few times, it became obvious to me that she didn't really want to do it. But whenever asked about it, she always acted very positive about it. It was a very strange disconnect between words and actions. I wanted to believe her. But it also scared me that she was possibly a really smooth liar and manipulator. At best, she was excessively unreliable and disorganized. I had given her enough chances. I didn't want to admit it after having such a great first impression of her, but it was not going to work. I knew she would be an important person in my life, and she was.

I've never seen that level of frustration and anger and sadness on someone's face before. And the fact that that was happening to my sister was almost as hard to take as the death itself. My parents took care of all the funeral arrangements and things like that. Harold didn't have any immediate family close by. In fact, only five people showed up to the funeral who were related to him. That was really awkward. About 30 or so people showed up from our side of the family, and our friends.

3OS4RQUCRA17ZZD54BFZOFIE98ZBFV,"For ten years I remember taking care of my mother before it became too much. I loved my mother very much, she was a very endearing human being and was outstandingly selfless. I remember it was a difficult adjustment when I first started taking care of her, there was a lot of arguing over who was taking care of who. Over time the arguing became less and less as she slowly started to realize she needed more and more help around the house, I think it hurt her pride to ask for my help around the house. A year before the idea of assisted living even crossed my mind we had a pretty serious incident that led to her hospitalization. My mother had seemingly walked out of the house in the middle of a snowy winter day and didn't remember doing so; she didn't even dress properly for the outside. She proceeded to wander aimlessly around the neighborhood until a bus driver took her aboard and back to the police station. Fast-forward from that event and the decline became too much to bare. I had to have her under constant surveillance as she'd slip without notice or find a way to accidentally harm herself while doing something that should have been mundane. I had managed to work up the nerve to get her into assisted living. The nerve wasn't mine alone as the doctor's also seemed to agree that it was time she entered this stage of her life and it was the safest way to do so. I agree with them and to an extent I think my mother would have too if she was still in full cognitive function. Sadly, I can only gesture and assure with kind words to her that I'm not forgetting about her or leaving her behind every time I visit. Three months have since passed and I've adjusted. I think my mother has adjusted as well but I'm still harboring guilt. So long as she's taken well care of I shouldn't have any issues, but I still wish I could take care of her in her own home that she raised us in.","I took care of my elderly mother for ten years.

You just never imagine it would happen to your loved ones. John was such a pleasure to be around. When my sister fell for him, I knew he was the right guy. He's been a good buddy to me and a great uncle to my son. Telling my son was probably the hardest part for me personally. Jimmy loved John so much. He's just old enough to sort of understand what happened and it absolutely breaks my heart. Now, that was hard for me, I am currently sobbing thinking about Erica. My sister loved him with every ounce of her being. They wanted kids. They wanted adventure. They deserved it all and now? None of us can imagine life without him, but he was her literal other half.

We spent so much time together, almost daily. The void left by his absence makes me feel like I am being pulled out of my own body. I remember a time when we went to the football game together.

We had decided early on in the planning that we didn't want to stress our wallets too badly on this wedding, and would rather spend out money on a lavish honeymoon. Still, the venue we found, a vineyard out in the countryside, was stunning. The morning of the wedding I woke up at my brother's. Cheryl thought it would be bad luck to sleep in the same bed the night before the wedding. Despite the wedding not being until that afternoon, I showered and put my tuxedo on right away. My brother was my best man, so he helped keep me calm. In no time at all the wedding time rolled around, and we went to the venue. I will never forget how I felt when I saw Cheryl walking towards me in her beautiful white dress. We said our vows and quickly went to the reception area. We danced and ate late into the night.

I found out in the worst way possible. I noticed that I was missing about $80 dollars. I know this because I keep a close watch on what I spend and document everything. Anyways, I'm actually surprised that he admitted to me that he took the money for drugs and that he's very sorry. He also agreed to do house work that I had been needing to do in order to compensate me for what he took. I'm upset with him, and slightly shocked that he would steal from me for drug money. But he really seems to be remorseful for it, and the fact that he didn't deny it when asked, and also agreed to go to meetings and reach out to people for help, and then has been actually going to those meetings for the past few weeks makes me hopeful for him. I try really hard to be supportive of him. He also opened up to me about the events that led up to the relapse. He lost his long time girlfriend of 4 years. Also, around the same time he was let go from his job because of an argument with management. He felt like he had nothing left is what he told me. I responded by saying I would help him look for jobs, if he agreed to get sober. So far, so good.","My son has been fighting drug addiction for several years.

While braxton-hicks contractions are normal at this stage, these were definitely not false labor pains. Three weeks ago, I delivered our 4th son, Van, via cesarean section in an emergency delivery. His umbilical cord was tied in a complete knot, and he was not getting the life-sustaining support he needed as a result. Even though he was early, he thrived. I wasn't at all surprised because he was utterly active in the womb, which is probably how he ended up in the situation he was in. He spent every waking moment kicking and keeping me awake. He's very much like this now! My husband told me that when they took him, he was blue and not breathing. They quickly got him breathing, and though I was completely out at the time, I feel in my heart that I could hear his first cries.

I couldn't afford the plane tickets for all seven of us, so my wife and I made the decision to drive the whole way in shifts. When one of us got tired, the other would pick up the slack. It was stressful to say the least to wrangle a bunch of screaming children asking ""are we there yet?"" over and over again. About ten minutes outside of Des Moines, my youngest child started complaining of feeling sick and developed a rash all over his body. The GPS told me we were very close to a hospital, so I made my way there as quickly as possible. When we got to the emergency room, Logan could barely breathe. The nurse on duty deemed the case to be of utmost priority, so she wheeled him in to see the doctor immediately. My wife, my other four children, and I waited anxiously for someone to give us an update. After about half an hour, a doctor approached us and said, to our relief, that Logan was just fine. It turned out he had an allergic reaction to the shrimp salad he ate at lunch. He has a shellfish allergy and needs to avoid most seafood from now on. The doctor administered an EpiPen which opened his airway and allowed him to breathe easier again. They induced vomiting which helped him feel better. He still had a rash on his body, but it was starting to go down. After a couple more hours of observation, he was released from the hospital and we resumed our journey.

Sure, we all kept in touch and occasionally a few of us would go out together. But, life had done it's thing and we were never all at the same place at the same time. I do not know how the idea for the camping trip came about. All I know was that when I read the message I was excited. I packed my bags and drove to the camp site on that Friday as we planned. The cabin was beautiful. A river flowed out into a lake. Perfect for swimming, lazing on a float, or just sunning on the beach. We spent most of our day doing just that.  But then the storm rolled in. It went from clear to cloudy in what seemed like mere seconds. We all scrambled to gather our things and get out of the storm. We huddled in the cabin soaked but happy. Once the rain stopped we went back to the lakeside beach and built a bonfire. Over the flames we talked about our lives, the struggles we've gone through and the successes we've had.

Some people gathered sticks and small brush. Others got larger pieces of wood. I helped get a spot ready for the pit. I helped gather large rocks. We ended up making a large pit, as there were twelve of us altogether there, and we all wanted to be able to sit around the fire. We didn't make the fire that big that night as it was just more for enjoying the camping atmosphere, but the pit we made could easily be used for a bon fire.

Well it started in my teens I enjoyed dirt bike racing, I was pretty good at it for awhile. I won my fair share of trophies and ribbon. But the NAtional Championship eluded me. My frustrations grew and grew, so I pushed the limits. I would increase the speed on the muddy curves when in reality I should have slowed down. Then one race I lost my control of the bike in the third turn of a rather muddy track. I flipped over rolling onto the track instead of off to the side. When one fellow biker could not elude me he rolled over my right leg and right arm causing breaks in both appendages. I was in traction for 6 months and I never could bring myself to get back onto a motorbike. BUt the daredevil in me still was my demon. I took up mountain climbing, I scaled the likes of the Half dome, the Matterhorn. But my one objective was Mount Everest.

My dad took me out diving and it was so incredible.   We had so many great Saturday afternoons spent on the water.  As I grew older and started to go to different places I met other dive masters.  I did't realize that people could get paid to go diving.  It was pretty cool to think that maybe I could do that for a job.  I put off getting my certifications because it's expensive.  It's also kind of scary to think that I will be responsible for other's peoples lives.  But the truth is that anytime you are diving you are responsible to help out the people that are around you.  I really think that now is the right time in my life to pursue this.  I've looked around at some different schools and I've picked the one that is going to be right for me.

My wife and I have always dreamed about our kids having a grandchild but we were doubtful it was ever going to happen. Our children said they were never going to have kids and were not interested in the thought. When we got home with him there wasn’t a thing I could do but look into his tiny blue eyes! He was such a small bundle of joy and so innocent. It brought so much joy to my wife as we haven’t had a baby in the house for 15 years. She was so compassionate about caring for him and it brought a new spark to her life. You could see it in her eyes that she wanted another child to take care of since our nest has been empty for so long. We were giving him a bath when she turned to me and asked can we keep him? They didn’t even want to have a child and now they have been blessed with this beautiful baby boy. I told her no but we will always welcome him in our home with open arms. We did not agree on this subject and she demanded we find a way to keep him or adopt our own. I don’t know what to do about this situation now because we are getting up there and age.

She can choose to do nothing and let the cancer run it's course and if that is her decision the doctors believe that should would have less than 2-3 years left to live.  Our my mom can choose to seek treatment which would require surgery, radiation, and rounds of chemotherapy over a course of the year. We are all frightened and scared, but ultimately we know that this is her decision and we must let her make it.

3RJSC4XJ11GEDFH60J51IMVH5E205B,"About four months ago, we made another family visit to India. We all knew this might be the last time we visited the country we had grown to love so much, because this time, the trip wasn't for happy reasons. Sure, I know, you're supposed to celebrate the lives of elders who die, but for me, losing my first grandparent wasn't something I could see a silver lining in. Grandpa lived in India, and Grandpa was dying. We first started coming to India almost 20 years ago, when I was a baby. My mom is Indian, born and raised in this wonderful country, but she moved to the United States to marry dad in her early 20s. Her parents stayed in the only land they'd ever known. In fact, Grandma and Grandpa had never even visited us back home in Alabama. We'd only ever traveled to them. We all wanted Grandma to move with us to the US when Grandpa died; he was the only family she had here in India, but she said she couldn't leave the only place she had ever lived. I sort of understood, but still, I couldn't see leaving Grandma behind when we flew home in a few weeks. The doctors estimated Grandpa only had a week or so left to live on the day we arrived in India four months ago. It was a long flight, and it felt longer because of the nature of our trip. Grandpa only lived for another day after we arrived. We got to say good-bye, and for that, we're all forever grateful. It's almost like Grandpa held on just long enough to see us, like he knew we were coming, and if he just fought a little bit harder and a little bit longer, we would all have so much more peace in his passing than we would have if we didn't get to see him one last time. We were supposed to stay in India for three weeks, but after Grandpa died just two days into the trip, my Dad, sister, and I changed our flights to head home after a week. Mom would stay for the full length of the trip to be with her mom and help her clean out Grandpa's things. Our last trip back to India was sadder than all the others, there's no denying that. There was no sightseeing, no gathering around the dining room table as we feasted on Grandma's cooking. There was no fanfare, no souvenirs, nothing but family and memories. And yet, it's my favorite memory of traveling to India. The days after Grandpa's passing were filled with memories and conversations, filled with laughter and filled with tears.

Finally I find it just a block away but was too drunk to figure that out. I chose it's time to drive home about an hour away. I'm driving down the highway when I see a construction zone ahead. Somehow I managed to drive into the construction zone area instead of turning left to continue down the highway. Just as I was back out to leave the area a cop pulls up next to me. He asks me what I'm doing, I just say guess I'm a bit lost. Next thing I know I'm getting arrested for a DUI. I get taken to jail, car gets impounded. This was a very annoying period of my life and I have never drank and drove since.","I experienced my first broken bone in my life when I fell skiing this winter.

The restaurant bar was pretty busy and noisy, but we couldn't help noticing a really cute group of guys sitting at the next table.  After about a half hour one of them came over to ask if we wanted to join them for drinks.  We did.  I found myself seated next to this really cute guy a bit older than me with dark brown hair.   We started talking and it turned out that we had some friends in common.  We also lived in the same neigbourhood.  He seemed really friendly and had a great sense of humour, which is a real plus for me.  After a couple of hours of chatting it was time to leave.  I had my car with me and my friends all seemed to have paired off with the other guys at the table.  I decided to offer this guy a lift home even though it was a bit out of character for me.  He quickly agreed and we walked to my car chatting along the way.  When we were about two blocks from his apartment he turned off the car radio and said he had to ask me something.  I thought that he was going to ask me out.  Instead, he told me that he lived with his girlfriend and that they had been together since high school.  He said that things were good between them, but that he was looking for ""a bit more"".  He asked me if I would consider being his girlfriend ""on the side.""  I asked him exactly what that meant.  He gave me a cocky smile and said ""you know.""  I told him that was not my style and pulled up in front of his building.  He told me that he was sorry to hear that I felt that way and had thought we hit it off.  I didn't answer him and he got out of the car.

3WYGZ5XF3X1HW7MLG8SRUHKJL3USKT,Dear diary. So I know it has been a while since I have written in you but I just wanted to keep you updated. About a month ago I woke up with some pretty bad tooth pain. Most of the morning I was in pain and finnaly ended up calling the doctor about it. They told me I should call my dentist as there was nothing they could do. So I call them and they told me that I had to wait until the next day in order to even see them. I tried taking pain meds and orajel and it did help a little bit but not as much as I hoped. So the next morning came around and I finnaly went there and the told me I needed a root canal! I was pretty nervous that it would hurt quite a bit but I knew in the long run it would be better for my teeth. So after about a 15 minute procedure it was all over. They were nice for the most part but boy did it hurt quite a bit. I would say after about 15 minutes it started to hurt worse but they did give me much better pain pills to deal with it. Later that night I was starting to feel a bit better. When I work up in the morning I was pain free and it was great. Overall I am glad I went and got it done quickly.,"I woke up with a painful broken tooth one morning and had to wait a day to go to the dentist. When I did, I had to get a root canal.

I drove in to visit my parents and siblings and we all decided to go to the Aquarium since my nieces had never been. That morning, I got up at my parents' house and ate some breakfast and some coffee while we chatted and watched some TV. My parents, my brother and I were going to drive over to the Aquarium later that morning to meet my sister and her husband and their kids. After breakfast, we hopped in the car and we drove off to meet up with the rest of the family. When we arrived at the aquarium, we found a parking spot and pulled in. We had arrived a little bit early so we sat in the car and waited for my sister to show up. We saw their car pull into the parking lot and my dad waved them over so they could park near us. Their family got out of the car and I gave my sister and her husband a hug since I hadn't seen them in a long time. I said hi to my nieces and we walked over to the entrance to the Aquarium. We got in line to get in as we looked at the walls painted with water and fish images. My nieces were enthralled by the walls and we hadn't even gotten inside yet. Upon walking through the gate, we were greeted by a large water tank filled with colorful fish and plantlife. My nieces immediately ran up to the tank and pressed their faces against it so they could look at it closely. We all laughed at how excited the girls were as we discussed where to go first. We decided to visit the penguins first since one of my nieces loves penguins. We walked down a hallway that had been painted to look like a glacier as we approached the room with penguins in it. Inside, there was a tank with water and ice and several penguins were swimming while others were walking around on top of the ice. My niece shrieked with excitement and started jumping up and down. We then visited the exhibit that had a couple sharks in it, but didn't stay for long since my nieces were a bit creeped out due to the darkness of the room and the sharks. We then stopped off to see a killer whale, but it was quite busy so we didn't get a great look at it. We stopped off at the gift shop on the way out and my nieces both got a stuffed penguin. We said our goodbyes and we drove our separate ways after having a very fun day with each other.","An enjoying day at the Aquarium during the summer. Fun for both me, my family, especially my nieces.

Now that the youngest one has graduated college and found his first job, we decided to sell our home.  We had it fixed up, remodeled the bathrooms, and had painters come and paint the walls.

The next step involved figuring out what would happen next for us. We had always wanted to travel more once our children had grown up and moved on, and we thought about some of the most cost-effective ways to do that. Well, long story short, we purchased an RV! We considered this to be a great way not only to travel but to save money on hotel rooms or staying in a rental home. While the initial cost of the RV was somewhat worrisome to us, we had an old friend that worked with someone in the RV business and he helped us score an awesome deal on a 5th Wheel RV. We couldn't be happier. We are able to live in the RV in one place for some time, and when we decide we want to go somewhere else, we do so very easily!

I'm a moderate conservative, and the way he's been running business sits uneasy with me. Anyways, just the week prior to all this the mine in the outskirts of the town collapsed, killing a lot of good folk. Lot of good men died on that day, its a damn shame actually.

3EF8EXOTT2HMR3H9L4DVX1XXG3A1JQ,"Dear Diary, it was a very hard two months after the theft of my husband's power tools out of his work truck.  He lost his miter saws, makita drills, and a lot of expensive woodworking chisels and levelers.  Fortunately, one of the neighbor's houses nearby had one of those smart doorbells and had video surveillance footage of the thief.  We called the police immediately afterwards and they were able to start on the theft with a decent lead.  The camera caught the thief's license plate too.  Unfortunately, my husband had a job lined up that we were counting on to help us pay for our bills, and he was not able to keep the job because all of his work tools were stolen from the trailer.  The police caught the thief within a week, but by then most of my husband's tools were gone.  We have the option of trying to sue the thief and claim some money in damages and lost wages, but we are not sure if it is even worth pursuing that, as the thief does not appear to be worth much money.  The hard part about this is because of our large family, we do not have much savings, and the two months that my husband was out of work, depleted all of our savings, and we were forced to sell our truck.  It was a tough decision, but we had no choice.  My husband will hopefully be able to buy a new truck if we get money from the thief.  While the two months were very challenging, surprisingly the event brought us closer together as a family.  Without his tools and not being able to work, my husband spent the last two month mainly at home with the kids.

I traveled all around the world, and even took one of those 28 day cruises across the Mediterranean down around India to Australia! I had been yearning to travel for a while, and now that I have seen so much in the last year, the world has certainly been a lot smaller. My first stop was in Europe. Specifically, Paris. While I started there, most of what I saw was just too touristy. Everything was extremely overpriced and I just wasn't feeling the culture, so after two weeks in Paris, I took a train across Europe intending on hitting as many cities as possible. About halfway through my trip, I found myself in Rome. Now Rome is incredibly beautiful and culturally rich. I really enjoyed seeing the Colosseum, and for the most part, it seemed less tourist based than a few of the other cities I encountered. I just really like the culture and history of the Roman period, so learning about that was fantastic. It was kind of crazy to consider how much of our society is structured around the politics of the Roman Republic. I was able to schedule a cruise while I was there, and it picked us up on the Italian coast. We went from Italy through the Mediterranean, making quite a few stops along the way. I think there were about 12-14 excursion ports? It was a very long trip that ended in Australia. While I was in Australia, I met a woman who had a wildlife sanctuary and she invited me to her place to see the kangaroos and koalas she had been rehabilitating. I had never seen a koala up close and personal before but she said they can be a little grouchy. I didn't have a chance to experience a grouchy koala though because they were all drugged up on eucalyptus. I stayed in Oz for about a month, and then I ended my travels by going to New Zealand and then Thailand before catching a flight back home.

After a number of hours of driving, I arrived at Niagara Falls. Niagara was an interesting place to visit. As I looked at the Falls themselves, I remember thinking to myself, ""That is a lot of water."" I can understand why this is such a tourist destination. The amount of water it takes to run these falls is substantial. I'm not sure a lake I live nearby has as much water, and it's considered to be a huge lake.

3SEPORI8WOL8L6ZDZ99AWWEQ4M1AZZ,"Wild ox, N.Y. (WKBW) — In isolated cases in various pieces of the state, Carlique DeBerry and Marla Fenner sold lethal portions of fentanyl. One got a 20-year jail sentence. The other got 5-long periods of probation. ""I think these two cases are not instances of something besides the realities. The realities and the law being applied accurately,"" Hon. Penny Wolfgang, a resigned State Supreme Court Justice, said. So why such a uniqueness between the two sentences if the wrongdoing was the equivalent? The explanation - government versus state courts. Carlique DeBerry, 40, Buffalo, was accused of ""dissemination of fentanyl causing demise"" in a government court. ""It was the medications that the individual disseminated that brought about the passing,"" U.S. Lawyer James P. Kennedy, Jr., said. That requires an obligatory least sentence of 20-years. Marla Fenner, 27, Geneva, a first-time guilty party, exchanged fentanyl for two yogurts and a squeezed apple. That individual later kicked the bucket from an overdose. The way in to her case is that she was accused of ""third-degree criminal closeout of a controlled substance"" in state court. ""Options in contrast to imprisonment especially including medications, attempting to empower treatment,"" Wolfgang said. She wasn't accused of a murder or even criminal carelessness (by implication causing somebody's passing). As per the First Assistant District Attorney Jason MacBride, under state law, demonstrating an immediate connection between somebody who overdoses and the merchant isn't simple. Actually, conveyance of a controlled substance warrants a more serious discipline than a criminally careless charge.

I was skeptical and had been pushing it off for a few years. The rent was just so much more in LA which was almost four times more than what I was currently paying. Not to mention the cost of living in general was so much more in California as well. It was also difficult because all of my friends and family were in New Jersey. Although there were a few musicians I was friends with, it would be almost like starting over completely since I wouldn't have my close friends anymore. However, I knew I had to try because there was so much more opportunities in LA. The music scene was much bigger in LA and there are a lot more venues that I could be booked at. My band had similar concerns but everyone except our lead guitar player, Bob, was down to go. Rob, our lead singer, didn't really have any doubts but our drummer John was difficult to convince. Anyways, we eventually got to him and decided to drive all the way from New Jersey to LA in our minivan. It was not a fun experience as everything was cramped because we had to squeeze in all of our gear. When we got to LA, everything seemed fine for the first few months. Our manager already booked us at a few venues prior to getting there and all we had to do was find a replacement for Bob. That seemed easy. Or so we thought. As we auditioned dozens of people, we quickly realized the mistake we made. The chemistry and energy Bob brought to our band was almost irreplaceable. He was an amazing backup singer and lead guitarist and none of the people we tried out came close to his level. We hastily chose someone else because we had a couple of shows coming up in a week.

It has been extremely hard to stay on track, but I'm thankful for the people around me who love me and held me accountable and continue to do so, to keep me from putting the pounds back on.  That is what I am focused on now, staying on the right track. I am working to continue to eat healthier and to exercise or do some kind of physical activity each day. Staying active and eating food I enjoy that is healthy helps me stay on track. I'm grateful for friends who know I work hard to stay on track eating healthy and make sure they always remember that when we are out or spending time together. It would be even harder if those sweets and unhealthy foods were around all the time! I'm going to keep working hard and stay focused on being healthy for myself and my loved ones. I enjoy how I look now and don't want to go back to before, so that is huge motivation! I feel more comfortable now spending time outside.

It feels like it was such a long time ago now. Things were so hectic, after the breakup, with the difficulties at work, and how much I was eating just to try to distract myself from everything.

It was tough to see all my friends enjoying themselves, throwing down pizza and ice cream and not being able to be a part of it. But it was worth sticking to my plan.

We never took that as just lip service since she was always telling us that but also showed us how to go above our situations. When I was 16, my mom went and got herself a small job in a factory. She needed the money and we took care of the home while she worked. For years, she slowly moved up from being on the ""belt"" to being in HR. She loved what she did and felt accomplished no matter what she was doing. Being able to take pride in any job she had was a lesson that by seeing her work, was something that she taught us. I didn't know that she had been saving for home. On the day her last child moved out, she told us that she had been saving money and wanted us to have it. She selflessly worked to make money to help us. We had all found good work and got out of the projects, we told her to get her dream home with it. She refused.

Seven weeks ago was my parent’s fiftieth wedding anniversary. I can’t believe they made it that long, it’s a huge deal. We threw a party, nothing too crazy because of their mobility issues, but we had a bunch of family fly out and a few close friends too. My brother couldn’t make it out, or at least he chose not to. Maybe it’s better he wasn’t there, he always adds stress and I don’t think he would’ve handled things well. In any case, during the day we all sat around and watched old family videos and looked through photo albums. My father went upstairs to take a nap before dinner. My mom and most of the family sat in the living room chatting and playing games. Rob and Jess and I went to the kitchen to start making dinner. We made a huge spread with everyone’s favorites, or most of everyone’s favorites anyway. We planned to eat at 6:00pm and we finished cooking almost exactly as the yellowthroat on my mother’s bird clock cheeped 6. My father hadn’t come down yet and my mother said to let him rest a little longer. I went and hung out in the living room with everyone and had a little wine. Before we knew it, it was 6:30 and the food was starting to get cold, still no Pop. Jess went up and knocked on his door and told him dinner was ready and he yelled back that he was coming. When he got downstairs he was pale, his foot falls seemed heavy, and he had this lost look on his face somewhere between a blank stare and scowl. He asked what everyone was doing here. We reminded him it was his anniversary and he seemed even more confused. He didn’t even seem to recognize anyone except Mom. It was terribly awkward. My Mom lives with him so she is most familiar with his forgetfulness, but even she didn’t think he’d forget their fiftieth wedding anniversary, especially after spending time with the family all morning. I’ll never forget the desperate look on my Mother’s face — then again, maybe I will if this runs in the family. I need to stop.","My parents' celebrated their fiftieth anniversary.

Although I was surrounded by a caring family, tragedy struck when I lots my mother at the age of three. I imagine being born into a family of three other siblings , including my twin brother, offered some comfort to this lost.  The ages of my brothers and sisters ranged from fifteen, thirteen and three. This created many challenges for my surviving parent, whose work commitments kept him away from home, often at night. It was decided that my twin brother and I would be split between relatives to relieve the stress created by my mothers absence. This, however difficult it is to imagine created for me a unique growing experience splitting my time between the city and the country. As I reflect on my situation growing up in this environment I realize that it offered me unique benefits, perhaps not experienced by other children growing up in more traditional arrangements. I have always had an outgoing personality and friendliness, generally attributed to a level of patience and flexibility in most social interactions I have with people, personally and professionally. This trait I know comes from leaning at an early age to adapt to change that comes unexpectedly. When my father re-married, I was ten and fell back on my experiences as a younger child to better adapt to yet another chapter in my family dynamic to unfold.

I often think just how blessed I am to have had 2 mothers, a twin brother and such a loving and unique family dynamic growing up.

One of the most memorable moments of the whole process came on a sunny, Sunday afternoon a few months back. We came across this great house online that truly fit all of our needs. It seemed like it was just too good to be true, a house that checked all our boxes and within our budget was just too good to be true. We contacted our realtor right away and said we need to see this house now! She warned us not to get too ahead of ourselves as the house had been on the market for a more than a couple of weeks and surely had many offers waiting to be approved. Regardless we wanted to go see it. As we drove up to the house it was even more perfect than the pictures could show, the street, the colors, the neighbors, and trees surrounding it were all perfect! We saw cars in the driveway and figured it was just other potential buyers but as we walked in we were greeted with an elderly couple walking out of the house. They introduced themselves and said they were on their way out and told us to enjoy the house. My wife and I said they did not have to rush out and could even stay if they wanted. This turned out to be the best decision! They walked us through the house and showed us every little corner and what made it all so special. They showed such detail and we did the same when explaining why this house was so perfect for us. We connected on a different level and as we left the house we told them we'd be making an offer the next day. It was going just like we imagined until our realtor called us and told us our offer was the fifth highest of all offers received. She mentioned the buyers were reviewing them all but again, not for us to get our hopes up as we were down there as far as offers went.

The first time was around 3 am and I had to use the bathroom, then another 30 minutes laying in bed thinking about everything. I dozed off and then around 6 am I just awoke worried about everything, school, tests, the semester, what my parents would think. After I laid  there another half hour I got up and had a cigarette and coffee and a cold bowl of cereal. I got dressed and went to my first class, Chemistry; I listened to the lecture and took notes, but they didn't really mean anything. I saw Phil between classes and he seemed happy and upbeat, I wish I had his drive and intelligence. After that I had Calculus and it just droned on, I don't feel like I belong here. I walked back home for lunch to make a sandwich, the apartment was trashed, the sink full of dishes and refrigerator empty. I got some bread out to make a ham sandwich and it was moldy so I just threw it in the trash and walked to McDonalds. Another Cheese Burger and small coke, it's all I can afford. I skipped my afternoon lectures and just stayed in my room watching YouTube video's on my phone and texting Anna, I think she wants out of this relationship. Maybe that would be best because she's not any more happy than I am. Now as I sit here writing this at my desk, thinking about dinner I really don't feel like leaving my room. I don't have the energy to go out and there's nothing here. I may just go home at the end of the semester and try something new.","I woke up generally depressed, twice before I actually needed to.

We were staring at each other through the shop. I scheduled my coffee trips around the same time that I thought she would be there. She seemed to have a routine which was not hard to follow. The more that I saw her the more that I felt this way for her. I could have the worst day at work or at home but just seeing her face gave me some optimism. Just by looking at her I felt happy, I felt that I could pull through the day just to get me back to that Starbucks. We started seeing each other so much that she just began saying hello to me. We would constantly greet each other but never had a conversation. I held the door for her a few times but never really spoke to her. I felt weird that I was in love with her yet we've never had a meaningful conversation. I don't know anything about her. I couldn't even figure out why I felt this way for her.

It was fun and exciting to see everyone and learn more about the family and where I came from. We had a BBQ and made burgers and grilled chicken, we had a few different salads and beverages. We played a few games of charades and cornhole and just reminisced about memories we shared together and with members of the family that are no longer with us. It was so nice to see everyone, the kids all had a great time playing games together. They played red-rover and man-hunt in the woods at the campground. They all came back after playing and roasted marshmallows and had watermelon. The campground is beautiful and the lot we had rented was great because it was right by the lake with beach access. If we had brought our canoes we could have pushed right off from them. We plan to do it again next year and make it an annual event, because we had so much fun. Next year we'll definitely bring the boats and maybe we'll camp out a night or two. The facilities were very nice and I think the kids would all like tent camping.

Well, not really thought, but I was slightly paranoid. First because the wait for the kidney seemed to span decades and I did not actually think I would ever get a new one until my gf volunteered to do it. She is literally the best thing that ever happened to me now. I still remember holding her hand as we were wheeled into the operating room together. That was the last thing I recall before I just woke up in a strange hospital room with one of the worst pains I ever felt in my life. And I looked down and I had this really gnarly scar on my abdomen. I felt like my favorite wrestler. I was in the hospital for maybe two more days max before I finally got to return home.

Before my time was spent at dialysis, but now I'm able to go hiking, and go on vacations, and go hiking, and just enjoy life. The new kidney has allowed me to appreciate life more too.  Before I got kidney disease, I wasn't really appreciating life for what its worth.

Since we were traveling by interstate there wasn't much to see. We expected to miss most of the Atlanta traffic since it was a Sunday morning but as we got into downtown, all the lanes on I-75 were closed down except for one. The line of cars stretched well out of site and we were lucky to move at all. My dad was trying to move over to the lane that the traffic was showing a bit of movement but he wasn't making much progress. Dad decided swap through a few of the local radio stations to see if there was any news of the traffic jam, maybe get an idea of how long we could expect the hold up. He really doesn't care for rock music so he ended up going between a couple of the country music stations. I stared at my Gameboy, trying to beat my high score on Tetris and not think about how bored I was while my sister was having a good nap. Mom was reading a book and would occasionally peak up to see confirm we weren't moving.

It was emotional experience for all of us, even our younger son, who had seemed almost happy to be the only kid in the house. Now he seems a little upset, just like my wife and I.

It's great seeing my husband succeed at such a wonderful company. This is a life-changing event for the both of us. It was a little surprising that he was able to find this job so quickly, with only two weeks on the job hunt, after having switch fields. For him, it's the accomplishment of reaching a long held goal. But for me, it was the worry and uncertainty at the idea of moving so far from home and my family. As happy as I was for him four months ago, I can't say I wasn't a little concerned and frightened at the idea. My family and I have always been extremely close. We take trips together, plan holidays with each other, are often going on vacations  with one another. My sister and I, in particular are incredibly close and consider each other best friends. Leaving them all back in Tennessee is hard for me, because I feel like I'm abandoning my family. Don't get me wrong I absolutely love my husband and I'm committed to supporting him. One of the best things about his job is the pay increase will allow for us to afford to send me back to graduate school. I just wish I could have picked up my family and moved them to California with me. It's been four months since I've last had a BBQ at their house, or teased my sister in person and I miss them dearly. Trey and I have made some new friends during this move, and they have been a great help for adjusting to this new life in California. In fact one of our new friends, went through the same scenario as me and she too had to move for her husband's job.

We had dinner at a highly-rated local barbecue restaurant that happens to be one of my favorites. I had a smoked brisket sandwich with french fries. My girlfriend had smoked chicken. The dinner was delicious, as usual, and we enjoyed our dining experience very much. My girlfriend surprised me again with tickets to a play at a local theater. The play was very good.

I was a little worried how things were going to go because we hadn't been dating very long at the time and didn't know how we would get a long when we were in each other space all the time. We were excited to see how all this would go but first we had to get through the move. I lucky have access to a truck so we didn't  need to rent anything. My girlfriend had to work that day so i started the move solo. It wasn't to bad at first since i just did the boxes but that went by fast. Next I started with the heavier stuff with a dolly like the washer and dryer. Next was the chairs and desk but i was starting to run out of the stuff that i could move by myself. I picked my girlfriend up from work and we got a quick snack before we got back to our new place with a great view of Maine. We then started the move with the couch its not very heavy well at least for me but we had to lift it to angle it through the door. That part was very frustrating but we got through it. Next was the mattress. It was much lighter than then sofa but to angle through the halls was a mess and we started to snap at each other. I think we were both getting tired and started to take it out on one another. After we got the mattresses in though that was it and we both calmed down and turned from grumpy to relieved.

Considering we lived together, we were both up all night feeling nervous yet excited. We wanted to walk across that stage so badly yet we were so afraid of what the future held for us. I think I was more nervous than she was though. The day of the ceremony, we both had overslept. She was freaking out about that more than me because she wanted to do her makeup and hair. All I had to do was shower and get dressed really. Thankfully, we made it on time. As we sat waiting for our names to be called, I was shaking whereas she held a calm composure. Her name was before mine so she got up and claimed her degree and everything. When it was my turn, that's when I full out embarrassed myself.

On the road in just a little under an hour. The boys started squabbling almost immediately, which we expected. I was prepared!

It was Sunday and for once it wasn't broiling hot outside, so Pat and I decided to get on the Harley and go for a cruise.  We weren't going anywhere special, no destination in mind, just riding in the country, taking in the scenery.  Maybe we'd stop somewhere for dinner when we got hungry or just stop off anywhere that looked interesting.  It was just a super relaxed kind of day with no responsibilities, no plans or schedules, just the wind in our faces.  We had been driving maybe two hours when the incident happened.  Out of the blue, with no warning, there was an armadillo in the road right in our path.  Like seriously, and armadillo? I didn't even know there were armadillos this far north.  I also didn't know they could move that fast, I thought they were more of a lumbering creature.  But there was no denying it was right there, almost touching my front wheel, and I had practically no time to react.  Time kind of slowed down like some kind of Matrix special effects.  I was able to consider swerving to the left and reject that idea because of oncoming traffic.  I was able to swerve right even as I cursed the loose sandy berm which I would have to go into.  I held onto the handle bars, readying myself to keep control and not go into a skid and the tires went from the hard tarmac to the gravelly sand.  Somehow I managed to keep us upright and out of the ditch.  Pat was a trooper, hanging on for dear life and leaning with me like an expert to keep from unbalancing us.  It all took a split second to happen but it felt like forever.  I pulled us back up onto the road, and we continued on our way unscathed physically, but mentally we were both deeply shaken. We haven't been out riding since.  But I'm not going to let it hold me back.  In fact I think I'll go out tomorrow.","A very relaxing afternoon motorcycle ride turns into a very scary experience.

I was listening to music during the ride too. The weather was nice and there weren't too many cars on the road. I was starting to think it was time to head back.

Not to mention the poor party planner dropping one of the pizzas all over the gift table. What a mess!

Goodness forbid I was at the party trying to help or be a part of his life. Its like as soon as he hit that milestone he stopped wanting me to be in his day to day. I just want him to be my baby boy again. I love that he is growing and becoming his own person, but I just am broken down by not having my little man around anymore.

It was very expensive as well and I see a long road ahead as I try to work and pay off student debt. The school was a place where I had wanted to go for several years before graduating high school but wasn't able to secure a scholarship to pay for it. I struggled a lot with myself and the school to try and pay my way through it. It was a difficult time and I was very unhappy with the way things were going. At the time of graduation, I decided not to walk with the rest of my class on that day because I was so upset thinking of the future and what was to come next. As I think back now, I regret that decision very much. I should have walked with the people I had grown close to. The students, the teachers and for everyone who supported me during that time. I am sure that I let a lot of people down because of it. Now that I'm out of college, I wish I would go back and do it again, just to walk with them and celebrate this achievement which I spent so much time and money doing. You can only do it once, and I should have done it. I should have looked past my emotions at the time and thought about the future and realized I would not feel this way forever. It was a temporary state and I would regret it later in life. It's unfortunate that this happened, but I will have to live with it forever now.

3PWWM24LHTK4W73MD4GIDUYOTQO829,Two months ago I finally made the call. After doing some research and getting recommendations from friends I called the highest rated therapist I could find. I was very nervous about this experience because I have never been able to share how I truly feel with anyone. I always worry about them judging me and no one in my life has really truly understood. I have had a lot of hardships as a child and I don't want to share all of them with people I have to see on a day to day basis. Finally the day came and I had my first therapist appointment. As I walked up the steps to the therapists office I was deep in thought. Was this the right choice? I was so nervous. I slowly began to climb the stairs. On the third step my deep concentration on the talk to come distracted me from my climb and I fell backward down the stairs and hit my head. Pain burst through my scalp and my head immediately began throbbing. I reached to the back of my head and felt wetness. I yelled for help. The therapist came running out of her office and called 911. I was rushed to the emergency room and diagnosed with a minor concussion and got 3 stitches for the cut in my head. So much for my first therapy visit. After a week of rest and recovery I once again returned to my therapists office and this time I carefully used the railing as I climbed the stairs. Today I safely made it in to the office for my first official appointment. The first appointment went ok. I was a little nervous but the therapist was kind and I decided to come back twice a week at her suggestion. Since that day I have been seeing her twice a week and I have been able to share many difficult feelings. The more I see her the more I trust her and the more I am able to share about my experiences. Sometimes details that I have not thought about in many years come to me between visits so it is very useful to be able to return later in the week to discuss again. My therapist has become an amazing support in my life and I will never forget my first therapeutic experiences.,I started speaking to a therapist about issues that have haunted and weighed me down for years.

3WMOAN2SRCJYW5OS7GPCXWLTO8HNV6,"These past couple of months have been an absolute whirlwind; Derek and I were approved for our first apartment together. We were both really nervous and on edge when we applied, our credit scores have been suffering lately since we racked up a little credit card debt on top of our student loans. But even in spite of our credit, we ended up getting the place we really wanted. We looked for so long and finally found just the right place, I mean we knew we would have to downsize our things coming from a house, but we just knew it would be worth it. The new place is so walkable, our neighbors are interesting and the place is gorgeous and just our style. The problem started though when we really got into downsizing. I thought it was going to be so much easier than it was, we were arguing all the time about who had to throw out what. There was a lot of resentment and hurt feelings, because naturally, the things that aren't yours don't mean much to you. So when I saw Derek's skis that he hadn't used for nearly two years I was determined to make him get rid of them. Why would we need skis in South Carolina?? We never take those kinds of trips. Or any trips really, so that started another fight about how we never travel anymore and it just became a huge mess. Who knew that something so seemingly insignificant as throwing out some clutter could bring up so many unrealized problems? I really saw how bitter I was about not traveling anywhere aside from our family homes and feeling like we were becoming boring. Really, this apartment and it's proximity to some excitement and nightlife was the hope on the horizon. The only obstacle being that we were at each other's throats and still loaded down with junk. I made a lot of concessions and threw out so many things, and unfortunately I threw out things out of resentment too. I regret tossing my white linen blazer. Who cares if he thought it looked silly? I really liked it. Anyway, we ended up getting through it all and moving into our dream house (apartment). I really love this new place, and I've been walking or riding my bike everywhere. I found a great new coffee shop that makes the most perfect peppermint mocha I've ever had, I found a little pub a few blocks away that has some killer bar food and great ambiance, and the shopping around here is perfect. This is exactly how I've always wanted to live, and it seems surreal that I get to have it now. The only thing I'm missing is my amazing relationship with Derek.

This caused me to get my self very wound up and have another panic attack. Once I was able to gather myself, I drove myself to the emergency room. The doctor there conducted all of the basic tests and still nothing was out of the ordinary. Being panicked, I  insisted that something was wrong and asked if there were any other tests that they could run. The doctor said yes, but also informed me that my insurance would likely not cover the costs of the additional tests. Being so anxious and upset, I agreed to still have the tests, even though my savings weren't anything special. So they ran a few additional tests and everything still came back negative. I eventually was convinced to go home and once again, wait and see if things got better. Of course, within a few days I was feeling as good as new.

Having a mechanic glance at it would have cost more than it was worth. I went around looking for a newish used car, but I had bad credit from some delinquent bills from college.  Most places wouldn't finance a car without a HUGE down payment.  I was just out of college and had no money and only an entry-level job.  Billy Bob's Used Cars said that they would finance anyone.  The cars in Billy Bobs had the monthly payments stickered onto their windshields.  The prices were less than I'd seen elsewhere.  I was really stressed out about the whole situation.  I was stupid and I rushed through the whole process and didn't carefully read the sales contract.  In the fine print was a little mention of this thing called a ""balloon payment.""  At the end of the loan, i was expected to pay a lump sum of $1200.  That was why the payments were so reasonable. I contacted the Better Business Bureau and the state Department of Consumer Affairs, but they both said that, while rare, car financing with a balloon payment was legal.  Just because the dealership failed to mention the final payment verbally doesn't mean that there's anything actionable in the agreement because there it was in writing.  I think the dealer and other dealers take advantage of the fact that some people just want to get the odious process over and done with as quickly as possible.

I just stood there thinking, ""I always wanted to be a mother, but am I really ready for all of this? I know it's selfish to feel this way, but it's not going to be all about me anymore."" I was so scared that I even contemplated giving him up for an adoption early on in the pregnancy, but that all changed once I had my first ultrasound. Three months ago....one bright and early Thursday morning...I began to feel strong contractions and instantly knew Mateo was ready to make his entrance into this world. I quickly called out to my sister and told her it was time. The trip to the hospital was a blur, I kind of felt like I was in a trance...almost losing my grip on reality. I finally came to once I was on the hospital bed and getting ready to push. The pain was so intense and again the doubtful thoughts began to come to my mind, ""Are you really ready for this? Are you really ready to be a mother and handle all that comes with it?"" Before more questions could continue racing through my mind, my body instantly took over and I felt a sudden urge to push. I pushed and pushed for what seemed like an eternity and boy was it painful! I felt so tired and thought I couldn't push anymore until the nurse yelled out, ""Keep going! His head is right there!"" I pushed with the last bit of energy I had left in me and Mateo made his grand entrance. The nurse placed him in my arms and....I know it's so cliche to say, but I instantly fell in love with him. Three months ago, I became a mother for the very first time to the most beautiful human being in this world and I am so grateful for that. I still have days where I wake up to self-doubting thoughts. It's not easy being a first-time mom and trying to navigate this new journey. But one thing's for sure, I know that I love being his mother and knowing that each day I get to wake up to be the best mother than I can be than I was the day before.",I had a son.

3PXX5PX6LYKC38WXTVT7AE7MOW9BAN,"Last night was my first night in my new house.  I still can't believe that this is actually my house.  Waking up in my house makes all of the stress from the past couple of months worth it.  All those homes that I toured and put a bid on only to find out that I was too late seem to have led to the perfect house - the house that was meant for me.  Then again, I cannot help bu wonder ""How can I have a house when part of me still feels like I am not really a grown up - not like my parents were when I was growing up""? Lol!  I know that I have a good job, worked hard to save for the down payment and went through all of the necessary paperwork but I still kind of feel like I am just playing ""adult"" and doing ""adult"" things.  I wonder if other people feel like this.  I am not really too worried about making the monthly payments which are about 1/3rd of my monthly take home pay.  Still, the thought of owing over $200K to anyone is a bit daunting.  Still, I can't help but spending all of my time thinking about how I want to decorate this place.  I find myself looking online at different websites for decorating ideas constantly.  I have book-marked so many things on Pintrest that I will have a hard time even remembering what it was about the site that made me want to book mark it.  I think that I will start in the living room.  I want to be able to come home at night and immediately feel like I am at ""my"" home. I think that this weekend I will go to Home Depot and pick up some paint.  I can't believe that I am actually excited about painting!  Two years ago, I would have seen a three day weekend as a time to party - now I am looking forward to painting baseboards and walls.

3IXQG4FA2UKYYPMS1PF7EJW36ADB9C,"Earlier this year, about four months ago, I bought my first house. It was an exciting occasion to be the proud owner of my own house. It was not easy though because it took a long time and a lot of hard work to make this a reality. It first started when my financial planner so many years ago told me that I should invest in owning my own home. He set out a 7 year plan for it. I told him that I wanted to make it on my own savings without credit or a loan. He decided to tell me that it would not be easy but it was possible. I sold the idea to my wife and she bought it. But she had misgivings because that meant we would have to make lots of sacrifices like doing away with our yearly vacations. I must say that she was a great help to me. There were times that I felt like giving up, for example, when our daughter was sick and she had to be operated on. There were times when I thought I could not make it because it was having a toll on me psychologically. Yet, I kept on with the plan and successfully scaled one milestone after the other. I must say that it is not easy to own a house. I do not envy homeowners and now that I am one, I understand what it means. But owning a house is part of the story. I have to make plans towards maintaining it. I have that in my plans. But right now, I am very happy.",I bought my first house earlier this year. It took a long time and a lot of hard work.

Two months ago, one day my friend came to home. He was seemed to be little tensed. I asked him for the reason. He said that his lover had a secret crush with another person. While talking he became more tensed. Suddenly he looked around and broke my guitar in anger. I was stunned for a moment. I don't know what to do at that time. I consoled him and made him to go to his home. I was upset for many days and did not play guitar. Knowing this my father bought me a new guitar two days back. Now I started to play it again.

Well about two days into my trip i got a call that i wish i had never answered. It was my uncle saying that my aunt was really sick and they did not know how long she had. My aunt had turned 90 a few days before this so her time was petty limited. Once i got to the hospital she didn't recognize me a first, but once she heard my voice she knew who it was. She was mostly blind so it was very hard for her to make out faces. I noticed that her breathing was really slow and her words were coming out so slowly. We talked for a few hours, as she reminisced on her life and her experiences. She told me about so many of the things she did in her life and all the people who she had come to know. she talked about her kids and mall my cousins and how  she was proud of all of us. She explained to me how proud of me she was in school bettering myself and she saw me being a very successful young man in the near future. I was at the home for about two hours before i saw her take her last breath. I wont lie that broke me seeing her leave this earth. I did not expect that to be her final moment. I was in tears and could not even  begin to comprehend what just happened. I started calling around to different family members and letting then know the news and that she had passed. My cousin, her son said he would be to the home in about an hour, so i decided to stay there until he came.

3ZQIG0FLQF2OJZX6ZHGZTFYKIIOWV6,"About 4 months ago, my husband had to have open heart surgery. It started a few months before that, when he complained about how much his chest hurt when he would exercise. I just chalked it up to him getting older, and joked with him that that's what happens when you're an old man, trying to run with the young boys. I remember the 1st time I noticed it, it was 7 months ago. He had just come back from playing basketball. I laid on his chest and could feel his heart beating insanely quick; I'm talking about it sounding like a ""drum roll please"" quick beat. I brought it to his attention but he just brushed it off as having a harder game today than usual. Things started going downhill quickly after that. 2 weeks later, he could barely walk up the stairs without being out of breath. I told him he needs to go to the hospital, the ER or something so they can at least listen to his heart with a stethoscope. He still refused, tried to pretend like nothing was out of the ordinary. Then, one day, he was so out of breath coming up the stairs, he passed out and ended up spraining his wrist. Thankfully he finally went to the hospital, and they examined his heart. Laying in the hospital bed, his breath suddenly became super heavy and labored, and one of the machines started making this really loud beeping noise. Doctors came rushing in, they ended up having to usher me out; they had to a CT scan/MRI on him. They found that he had 3 damaged heart valves, and because of that, his heart wasn't able to get enough of his oxygen in his blood to his lungs and every subsequent problem. He had to have emergency heart surgery. Recovery was expected to take 6 months, with very light exercise after 3 months. Only 2 more months left until he's fully recovered.

It's been two months since we opened our business in this wonderful location, and everything is going wonderfully.  But I have to keep reminding myself that it could have turned out very differently.  Every time I start to remember the horrible weeks leading up to the grand opening, I have an almost irresistible urge to go find Douglas (the hubby and other half of the business) and give him a big hug and a smacking big kiss for being such a rock through it all.  First, 4 weeks before the date, the landlord contacted us to say he thought there might be an unforeseen termite problem with the property.  Then a week later, no termites, just water damage, but might need to postpone tenancy.  Great, since our current lease at the time was due to expire and we had to get our stock and everything out of the store.  Then our movers went out of business.  Next, our suppliers  contacted us to say they were having problems with labor and shipping, and could we wait eight weeks for delivery.  The answer to that was a definite no, and I went power shopping to find new suppliers and fallback shipping.  Before I got new suppliers lined up I was tempted to just chuck it all in.  But Douglas got our friends to pitch in, we found an alternate location, new movers,new suppliers, an army of friends to help, and it actually happened.    The opening went off without a hitch, business is booming.  Life is good.  Out of disaster came the best business move we ever made.

Many years ago a girl opened her heart to me, she told me things she said she had never told another soul, she felt that she could trust me more so than any other person in her life. She meant the world to me, my whole soul lit up the moment she entered the room.  I felt myself really falling for her personality, her smile, her laugh. I was very honored that we were able to share time together, it really meant something to me and I hope that it had meant a lot to her as well.  When she told me that she was moving cross country, I was heart-broken. I truly thought that she would be in my life forever and yet that was not the case at all.  She had been assigned to a job which would take her away from me and possibly to new countries and new adventures. I might never see her again and I felt that was almost too much for me to bear. We did keep in touch, and like I suspected, contact became less and less until it was almost gone completely. I went on with my life, found other people to spend my time with. Dated, and dated some wonderful people, but none really compared to her. I found she was on my mind, if only in the back of my mind as the gold standard to which anyone I met was compared against. It was definitely difficult to compare and my relationships always suffered as a consequence of it. Then one day, just last week my life changed forever. I heard it first, that magical laugh that always captivated me. I had to seek the source of the sound. Although many years had passed, I could remember it like it was yesterday and so many feelings came flooding back.  When I turned around I discovered it was her - it was really her! She was standing there a huge smile on her lips. It look me by surprise I never thought I would see her again and yet there was was standing before me. We talked for hours as though we had never been apart. To find out that she is moving back to our town, that she is single and still thinks of me as I had thought of her is almost a stroke of magic. I look forward to the years to come and hope they are just as magical as the very first day I laid eyes upon her.",A story about love and second chances.

3VBEN272MLLCULQ2QH7CWPSPGDGGSZ,I was pregnant and i was just about to give birth 5 weeks ago. I remember i was in the emergency room about to give labor to my new child.  While i was giving birth my mother was at my home that was near by.  While she was there she ended up stealing some things that were inside of my home. I was very unhappy with her for doing this. I felt that she betrayed our family by stealing while i was giving birth to my new daughter. I felt very betrayed that she would do such a  thing especially while i was giving birth. It was a very sad time for my family.  We all felt that she was a very bad mother to do this to me. I have chosen to not talk to her anymore since she did this. I feel it will be a long time before i talk to her again.  She has tried to call me but i have chose to block her number.  For the time being i will need time before i talk to her again.

3VW04L3ZLUSVCO7R91D3JJ9DWOYXXC,"But I had to learn to use CPR and quick, as the elderly woman I had been caring for was on the floor having a seizure.  I was not used to caring for elderly patients either but somehow I got stuck with this useless hag after she was brought into our emergency unit after she had her first seizure. I had been a nurse for thirteen years and I didn't sign up for this shit. I was used to caring for younger, healthier patients that could perform basic tasks like wiping their own ass and bathing.  Even the cripple down the hall in a wheelchair is easier to take care of than this useless old bag as even he could wipe his own ass.  But nevertheless as I was getting ready to administer drugs to a patient in psych I was called to the emergency room because an old bag had a seizure and was now flopping around like a fish on her gurney that the EMT'S had strapped her onto.  They asked me to give her CPR and I asked if there wasn't anyone else around?  They said no all the nurses were busy in psych so for the first time ever I had to give an elderly woman mouth to mouth. I took a big gulp and took a long sip of water.  I wasn't mentally prepared for what I was about to do.  I closed my eyes and tried to picture the elderly woman was a more attractive younger, man.  My lips met hers and I nearly gagged as I was literally giving her mouth to mouth. I kept blowing into her mouth until finally she started coughing into my mouth and I jolted back in disgust.  The old bag had woken up and stopped shaking all over the place. Completely disgusted with what I had just done I immediately lifted her up and put her on a different gurney and was on my way to the elevator to bring her to psych when the EMT asked why I was going to bring her to the psych ward and not general care.  I lied and said we had no beds left and I really wanted to dump her off onto someone else and make her someone else's problem.  So I brought her up to psych and sedated her as she started talking non stop about her son and how he never calls her anymore.  I injected her with a large dose of oxycontin and she was out like a light.  I came back later to check on her and she wouldn't wake up.  I checked for a pulse and nothing.  She was stiff, dead as a door nail.  I panicked because I realized I had drugged her to the point where she must have died in her sleep.  I didn't know what to do, I didn't want to go to jail and I had been fired from three previous jobs for neglect. Then I remembered something, we had a patient with down syndrome who could barely spell his own name, let alone be able to tell what was going on.  So I sounded the alarm for a ""code red"" and blamed Timothy the guy with down syndrome for the elderly woman's death, I said he must have choked her while I was out changing bed pans.

I had my son in swim classes and while he learned a little, I didn't feel it was worth the money to do another class.  I decided that individual swim lessons would be a better idea and signed him up for that. We got there a few minutes early and got him ready to go into the pool.  We met the instructor, she seemed nice and my son liked her so that was a plus. I sat up on the bleachers as the instructor led my son into the pool.  First she tested to see what he knew, if he could float or do any strokes at all.  After that she started to instruct him on how to kick properly and how to doggy paddle.  He was able to pick up everything she taught him, he was listening really well and seemed to be having a good time. After the hour was up he had a lot more confidence in the water and was excited for his next lesson.  A week after the first it was time for the second lesson. My son was in an exuberant mood, ready to learn how to swim. We got there and he immediately walked over to the pool and yelled hi to the instructor.  This lesson she focused on teaching him freestyle strokes.  He struggled with it at first, but eventually picked it up.

Mom has dementia and every night as the sun goes down, she becomes agitated and restless. It becomes more difficult everyday working with her because of the progression of the disease.  I know I will get very little sleep, especially this night.  However, on the night of the full moon, for unexplained reasons, mom becomes even more restless and paces constantly. I feel bad, but I must make sure the extra code locks are locked for the outside doors, to prevent my mom from going outside at night and wander off, as she has done in the past. . During my mom's pacing episodes, she also constantly repeats the same sentence over, usually, ""I want to go home"". Even though mom is in her own home, she is unaware of her surroundings, which is more the case lately. I have to keep reassuring mom that she is at home. As the full moon gets higher in the sky, the more restless mom becomes and goes to each door trying to open the door. When the door doesn't open, mom then proceeds to each window, fortunately, most window locks are higher up or too hard for her to open. I keep asking mom to sit down and watch her favorite TV shows, I Love Lucy, but she can only sit for a few moments and then gets up again to start pacing the floor. I get out the old photo albums and try to jolt her memory to something in the past that she might remember, suddenly she looks more diligently at a picture of me as a baby where she is holding me in her arms. She stares at the picture and runs her fingers over the photo, for just a few fleeting moments, she has a look in her eyes that she remembers that time in her life. She mumbles my name and I see my opening cue to talk about when I was little. Mom then starts on the story of how I acted as a child, even though I have heard this story many times before. On these nights, the dementia that has stricken my mom seems worse, robbing her of her present memory and ability to take care of herself.

About two weeks ago I was doing sales calls to to my minor accounts to try to drum up some business, just a routine day really. As I walked into the main entrance and waited for security to get me my visitor badge they mentioned my normal contact person was on vacation and I would be meeting Jim from operations instead. I thought this would be unproductive as Jim will not be able to sign off for any new budget items. Well at least this I can drop off some sales sheets and some swag and build up a little good will I thought. When we met in the conference room I sensed that something was different about Jim. He seemed like a good guy, he had a warm handshake and seemed interested in what I was talking about. The conversation drifted to other topics that I was not expecting like charities he supports and volunteers for. I told him I really did not have time for that and I would toss a donation every now and then to a random charity. He asked me if I did that because I felt good to do something or really wanted to help. I said I really donate just to seem like a normal person and not stick out in the office as a dolt. When he asked if I was free for a couple hours on Saturday I said I really did not have anything going on.  He gave me an address and said ""be there by 8:00am ask for me"".When I arrived at the mission church on Saturday morning and saw the need I was blown away. Those few hours of serving breakfast to people who I never really looked at before opened my eyes. I really don't know why a chance meeting a meeting that I never thought would happen has opened my mind to a higher purpose in life.","A meeting that I cant get out of my head, Im not sure why but this guy really made a huge impact on me.",14.0

I felt disconnected from my family, I felt we were too reliant on our phones to socialize, and it wasn't healthy at all. I wanted a change in my life. So, me an my family took a day to just toss them to the side and see how it went. It was a massive success, I was able to connect with my daughter and talk about school and how she was doing--just get to know people, not the fakeness of what's presented through text. That isn't who a person is, they have their mannerisms and their ticks and their emotions that are hidden by sterile fonts and distance. You don't truly get to know someone until you look them in the eyes and talk to them, and we had a lot of fun doing this. I think I'm able to appreciate my family more now. We're able to talk without using our thumbs. We're able to be together without having to ignore people with our phones in our face.

Since then I spent about a week relaxing and trying to catch up on some things. I've picked back up some hobbies and found some happiness in those.

Since the person was such a dear friend of my father's, I was understandably worried to approach him about the matter. The family friend who sexually harassed me was Larry, who has been a fishing buddy of my father's for years. We were at the barbecue that was to celebrate the graduation of cousin Gertie. Everyone was laughing and having a great time, and I too was enjoying having a swim in the pool. I found myself at the deep end of the pool, and I had always been a little bit fearful of swimming over my head. There was no one else at the end of this pool and I was caught in my own world when I felt a hand brush against my thigh. I jerked away and my heart raced. At first I though something in the water had bit me. Or maybe it had just been a pool toy. But then I looked up and saw old and disgusting Larry with this sick grin on his face and his hand still near my thighs.

He acts like it somehow detracts from my ability to have rational thoughts and opinions. As if struggling with a mental health condition makes me less credible. If I had a physical ailment, would he do the same thing? Every time he does this, I feel so gaslit. Given the context, it's even more hurtful. A parent should take the side of their kid on something like that. You would think he would be angry on my behalf for what happened to me. Instead, he just tries to argue with me about whether it actually happened or not. It seems like he's more willing to defend his friends than stand up for his children.

3VSOLARPKCVTVUIFMW01W0YRJ4M398,"The last few months have been difficult in my household. A little over three months ago, my husband was injured on the job site. This has been challenging for us both from a financial standpoint, as he is on workers comp instead of receiving his full pay for working, including his usual overtime hours, and from an emotional standpoint. It is difficult for him to sit idly at home most of the day rather than being productive in his physically demanding job. He is becoming very restless but is limited in his ability to even complete projects around the house during this time off from work due to the nature of the injury. He does attend physical therapy three times a week which gives him an outlet outside the house but progress is slow and on days after physical therapy, he's more exhausted and the pain flares a bit more so he's resigned to the couch for most of the day afterwards and can't even do many minor chores around the house. They told us it should be getting easier by now, but it's just not and that's hard to deal with. I don't know how many more months of this we can take. It's hard for me to shoulder the burden of the majority of the household tasks as he is physically unable right now. The other challenge is financial. We had become accustomed to the extra income from his overtime hours, and while I'm thankful for worker's compensation to help cover most of the missing income, it doesn't help with the income above and beyond his base rate. We had been making progress in building up our emergency savings and having some extra disposable income. Now without the overtime hours, the savings progress has come to a screeching halt. It's frustrating to say the least. I have no ability work overtime hours at my job so we're fairly stuck income wise for the time being.

I remember when he was a baby and he told me how much he loved life where we were and how he never wanted to leave. I wish I did not lie to myself all these years and think him honest in that situation. James has been my only child for these long years and I have cared for him as best as I could. I have worked several jobs to make ends meet and allow him a childhood that was stress free. In fact, he believed us wealthy because of the gentle disguise I held over his eyes. I do hope that he will be happy wherever he ends up. I know not what Florida will bring to him, but it will be an adventure for him nonetheless. I know I sound like I am rambling, but I just do not know how to get my feelings straight about James and my mind is going very fast at the thought of not seeing him for a long while. I take refuge in the thought that I will indeed see him again at Christmas. He has made a promise to return and James always keeps his promises, no matter how small. I always knew he would leave me and move on to his own life, but I did not want it to be true and I thought maybe just not thinking about it would make it go away. That is not right it appears. My thoughts have been on my husband of late as well. I wonder where he has gotten to on the other side. I lost him several years ago when James was a small boy and now I think of him everyday as well. Who would have thought that several years ago I would lose my husband to a disease and now I am losing my son to a move. One of them is one that I know I have to do, but if you would have told me years ago what would happen in my life, I would not believe it. The only person I will have left with James gone is not a person at all. My cat will have to be the replacement for James and those are hard shoes to fill. I am talking too much about myself here. I am very glad for James because he will go to college and met a lot of new people and make a happy life for himself.

I’ve been trying to raise my kids with the same values that were instilled in me, so four months ago, I brought my daughter along for our charity food truck run.	We were just going to drop off some canned goods and a few baked goods my wife baked, but my daughter took it one step further. She wanted to get some plastic eggs and fill them with Easter candy to hand out along with the food. Bless her heart. I know people say that teenagers only care for themselves, but she’s such a good girl.	So, we did exactly that. On the way to the shelter, we picked up some eggs and candy, only a few dozen or so. We sat right in the back of the truck and individually placed candy in each egg. We grabbed a couple of baskets, plopped the eggs in, and drove on over.	I couldn’t believe the affect that such a simple, inexpensive gesture would have on these folks. I know they’re usually grateful when we drop off food, especially around the holidays, but this little extra something special really drove it home for them; people truly do care about each other.

This was my cousin from my mother's side of the family.  I'd known her since I was a small boy and we'd always been really close.  She wanted me to be in the wedding in some capacity but I had work obligations that made that impossible so I could only be a guest.  But we were both content that I just made it; I can't fathom having missed it.  Anyway, the wedding was held inside in a church.  My cousin wore a gorgeous white wedding dress with a long train.  I thought it was really classy, while still being modern and sexy, which seems like a thing these days.  My nuclear family was with me and thought the same thing.  I was disappointed to not get to see that much of my cousin during the weekend, but I guess that's the nature of weddings and what happens when you're the bride.

Each night the whole extended family would pack into someone's room, order pizza, chat, watch TV, reminisce, and just have a great time bonding.

He's such a great guy and treats my cousin so well.  I'm so happy for her, and for him, since she's wonderful too.  At the end of the weekend we all said goodbye and tearfully went back to our own lives.  But it's always fun to get together for these types of events.  Seeing the whole family again, like we used to when we were young and had family reunions--it's just so much fun and so comfortable to be around those people.

When I first took this job, I was told that the person who's position I was most qualified for would be retiring within the year.  The position I took was a way to get my foot in the door and I would be first in consideration upon his retirement.  So I took it.  I worked alongside the man, who ended up not retiring after all.  He didn't do well in saving his money, so he couldn't afford to.  My boss kept promising me that this would happen and just be patient.  I started looking elsewhere 2 years ago when I figured this would never come to fruition.  Something always held me back from leaving though.  The company was sold a year ago, but our office was kept intact.  I met new management, who made me the same promises after looking through my work history.  I was ready to leave.

33LK57MYLURCL2L7G9V1HW8VSNMZSO,"Just four months ago, my daughter married her long time boyfriend.  I always knew they would get married but it was still kinda surprising and emotional when they announced it.  The wedding itself was just a small family affair that happened at the court house with a celebration afterwards.  She wanted it like that and I was fine with it too.  It was less planning and fanfare which is more her style.  One of the best things about this wedding is that my son came and he and my daughter got to be reunited with each other.  They've been arguing and hostile with each other for the past five years so this was kinda a big deal.  I was so glad to see them finally reconcile with each other because it's been a huge strain for me having them fighting with each other.  It makes it hard because neither will come to family get togethers like Christmas if they know the other is there and this makes me so sad.  I want the whole family together and it's just not the same if one is not there.  So this was a big deal to me and made the wedding all the more meaningful.  I didn't know that my son was going to come and actually I expected him not to, so I was really surprised when he showed up.  I saw him talking to my daughter later that night at our house and I expected it to get heated but to my surprise they were laughing and smiling.  Turns out from what he told me later they both apologized to each other and decided life was too short to continue arguing.  I am so glad and warmed in my heart that they have made up with each other.  It was tearing my heart apart that they had tension with each other and now I feel so much better.  I just hope they can continue getting along and don't fall back into that horrible state again.  Now I can't wait to become a grandmother.","My daughter got married to her boyfriend.

3TESA3PJ32W9O09JHN9LXLDGUCSMMX,"Six weeks ago, my buddy came to me seeking some advice or help on an issue of his. He had been really stressed out at his job, was feeling burned out from it, and was having trouble sleeping. He knew that I have a background in psychology, as well general health and well being, so I might be able to help him out. We first talked about what he thought might have been triggering the stress and anxiety at work. He said that he was having trouble concentrating because he was always feeling fatigued at work. This fatigue was starting to impact his job performance because he was struggling to get all his tasks done during the work day. The next thing I asked him was how well he was sleeping at night, and he said that he was having a lot of trouble falling asleep. In fact, he would toss and turn for a while, and then he would get on his phone for a little while, hoping that this would make him sleepy. I explained to him that maintaining proper sleep health is really important in having high quality sleep. People should only ever do two things in bed: sleep or have sex. The reason for this, is when you do other activities in bed, you are confusing your brain on whether or not you should be sleeping. Because of this, when you lay down in bed, you should never be reading or on your phone because this can compromise healthy sleep. After that, we talked about nutrition. Eric tends to eat oatmeal for breakfast on most days, a sandwich and vegetables or fruit for lunch, and he usually orders takeout for dinner. This did not seem like a big deal to me, but when I pressed him about what he typically drinks on a daily basis, he says that he pretty much just drinks sodas or coffee all day, and only stops the caffeinated drinks half an hour before bed. I explained to him that this is a really unhealthy habit. Not only are you putting yourself at risk for diabetes and hypertension from that level of caffeine and sugar, but you are also making it very difficult for yourself to fall asleep when you drink them almost all the way up until you go to bed. My recommendation for him was to significantly cut out the caffeine from his diet (as well as drink more water), and try to maintain healthier sleep habits. These things have worked for me in the past, so I am sure that they would work for him.","I met with a second individual (""Person A"") regarding this individual's personal issue and, based on my personal experience and education, offered suggestions, insight, and strategies for dealing with Person A's issue.",42.0

Things were all over the highway and I knew he would need help to get it picked up before they got damaged or caused an accident. I decided to pull over to the side of the highway and assist him with picking his items up. We got things picked up from the highway and back into his truck. I used some extra tie down straps I had in my truck to help secure his items. After all of that was done we got to some talking and I find out that he is actually the CEO of a tech startup. He offers me a job on the spot saying that he would love to have such a kind person working with him. After a series of bad investments and bad luck, he eventually had to shut down the company.

The trip was 1 week long so we were constantly going out and enjoying ourselves since we wanted to do a lot in such a short amount of time. Once we arrived we got settled at our hotel, and then the next day we went out to see the volcanoes and then went to dinner.

I always thought of chess as something of a “nerd sport”; less of a sport and more of an assignment .. like homework. It wasn’t until experiencing the play-through of chess and learning the significance of each piece that I began to take interest in it . Cut to a few months after my first game that I thought it would be an excellent idea to join the chess club, and eventually we found ourselves in a few tournaments; Everyone in my school that takes part in the tournament takes it very seriously. This isn’t like a game of connect four, where you go, “Aww, man,” and laugh when you’re defeated. When you lose, it means(at least to us, and the other teams taking part) that you have lost something more than a game.

3IJXV6UZ1Y5EPXWK1G7ARR0A7MYRIJ,A couple of weeks ago I lost a big pile.   I had been betting on volatility at the end of the year.   The market has seen volatility sink to all time lows.   I figured the only direction that things could go is up from here.   How silly was I.   As the saw goes:  the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.  I was so convinced volatility would trend up I employed the largest dose of leverage I could get from my broker and levered it even more with options.  And then I compounded it by betting large on Bitcoin rising.  Can you say oh for two?  All of my options contracts expired at the end of the year worthless.   If volatility  has spiked or Bitcoin had popped I would have made a killing.  It would have been the best late Christmas or New Year's gift ever.    As it stands now I'm going to have to cut way back on my spending just to be able to pay off Christmas presents in 3 months.   What a tough situation to be in.  Why couldn't the market come around to my view?   My finances hurt and so does my brain.  I'll have to stay away from exotic trading instruments.,I lost a huge amount of money in the market market.

At first, I don't know why he has this and even this is allowed to be in here. I didn't know how to react to this bear because I didn't expect it to be there at all. I had so much questions to my friend on why he has this bear in the first place. When I got there, I was in complete shock because it is bigger than I expected. This is a beautiful creature and I would like to pet it but I was scared. I talked to him about the bear and asked what is he going to do with it. He said hes going to keep it but I don't know how I feel about that. So I suggested that he should let him out of the wild because bears are not pets. We fought throughout the whole which got me really frustrated because I have no idea why would he keep it at all. I know that these are not meant to stay here and it should out there. I told him that I would take action if he doesn't let this bear free. At the end of the day, he told me I was right and we let him go. I knew he wanted to keep him but I know that its better for the bear more than him.

His long term prognosis is a return to full health. After surgery, his restrictions will include an inability to lift weights. My mother and sister are distraught, but glad he will be home soon. His manager at work has said he will be paid in full during his time away. That takes a lot of stress off the family in general. As for me, I am scared.

I am finally writing this down because last week he got the news that he is going to be getting a new kidney. i am so relieved and i cannot even imagine the relief he feels.

My job offered me a higher paying position in Texas and my wife had just been laid off her job, so we figured ""Let's do it!"". We were both pretty excited about the move and I knew I could make back the cost of moving with only two or three months of work in Texas. An agent found us a beautiful home, we sent our belongings out ahead by moving truck, and my wife and I packed a few items in a Uhaul to make a road trip out of it. Our spirits were high and it was almost like a fun getaway driving to our new life. We didn't recognize the first signs of trouble, but they were there, literally. As we entered the State, Trump signs began spotting the roadsides with sayings like Build the Wall, Muslims Go Home, Lock Her Up and Trump Will Make Us Great Again. We saw them and didn't think twice about it because we were so happy and focused on enjoying our road trip. The sun was setting as we drove up to our new home and the house looked exactly like it did in the online pics, except for the 6 or 7 signs sprinkled across our new lawn. There were lawn signs that said things like Build The Wall - Make America Safe Again, No Illegals - Lock Them Up, etc. We didn't know whether they were a welcome to the neighborhood gift or a warning to go home. I looked over at my hispanic wife with concern and she began crying. ""We can't live here"" she said.

I freak out and immediately hopped in my car and sped over there. When I got to her she was in a great deal of pain and could not move without help. She said her entire chest area felt numb and was like being stabbed with a knife over and over. Once we got to the hospital the doctors immediately noticed her symptoms resembled that of a stroke. They did everything they could do and informed me that they would need to hold her for a number of days to run tests. Surprisingly, when the tests came back they showed that it wasn't a stroke, but a rotator cuff tear. Due to the fact that they mimick similar symptoms, rotator cuff tears are often labeled as strokes early on because of the sheer amount of pain the patient is in. Once we were given the news it was a remarkable relief. Even though my mother has been forced to undergo significant physical therapy over the last few months, so is finally getting close to 100%. A stroke at her age would have been extremely detrimental to her further health, so we are very thrilled that she was held at the hospital for extra time. I also remember thanking the doctor for being thorough at the time. I remember that he mentioned it could possibly be something aside from a stroke, but I simply disregarded it at the time.

I began to wonder whether I would be able to refrain from being overly emotional if we actually met in real life because looking at her would remain me so much of my husband.

Or maybe there’s a completely different kind of stressor in your lifeStill, you might worry that your emotions will be too overwhelming. While this can happen, people tend to get stuck because they’re actually not feeling their emotions, Hibbert said. “Instead, they think about, wallow in, and replay events. But they are not letting themselves really feel the pain, loss, sadness, anger, that is lurking withinWhen people bottle up challenging situations, the problems grow and mutate into horrible worries and anxieties,” said Ryan Howes, Ph. D, a clinical psychologist and author of the blog “In Therapy.” Talking about your troubles, however, helps you better understand your own fears and get valuable feedback from others, “who have probably experienced similar levels of distress and can give you the perspective you need. While you might not have time for your usual healthy habits, you can still take good care of yourself. For instance, if you can’t prepare a nutritious meal, keep protein bars in your bag, she said. If you can’t go to the gym for an hour, take a 10- to 15-minute walk around the block to “relieve physical tension and clear the cobwebs in your mind.”Ten minutes of meditating or a 20-minute power nap also helps, she said. Remember that a stressful situation isn’t a sprint; sometimes “it may be more of a marathon. [You] need to pace [yourself] and take the necessary time to rest to reboot your mind and body.”“During a moment of meditation or prayer, visualize handing those items over to your higher power and letting them go. Then focus on what you can control, like your self-care, your words, your actions and your decisionsYou might assume that you can and should handle this difficult time on your own. Many people do. But, interestingly, when Duffy talks to his clients, most say they’d never expect others to manage similar situations alone. “We need to relinquish control, ask for help, and receive it with grace.”When asking for help, you may need to be direct. Let others know what you need, such as “support and compassion,” and what you don’t need, such as “[not] criticiz[ing] my slowness to heal,”",My son overcame a hard year in which he was labeled as difficult.

Maybe it was the booze, or the closeness of our relationship but we all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. I am not sure that we would do it again but it was a new spice to the relationship. I think if you were looking at adding something it shouldnt be the first thing you try but overall can be rewarding. We also were in the same room so got to see our partners in action.

I ended up making the trip with another colleague of mine so we could chat on the way.  When it came to the day we got in the car and left.  When we almost were at the city we saw a big accident.  An 18 wheeler had gone under a bridge and gotten stuck!  I was very surprised to see this as those bridges/tunnels are usually clearly marked.  The road under the bridge had narrowed to one lane.  Traffic was being directed through it by police.  II assume they were trying to get the truck unstuck from the bridge overhead but I'm not sure how they would've accomplished that.  Two days later, when we were making our trip back home the truck was gone.  The road was back to being two lanes like nothing had ever happened.  It was an interesting experience.  Me and my colleague chatted about it a bit on the way back.  We were both surprised to see it in the first place.  We told work about it the next week when we got back.

Last night I told her we needed to prepare, and she was so excited! I had her go into her closet and pick out her favorite outfit. Maria picked out a pink t-shirt that says ""I <3 MERMAIDS"" with a pretty picture of a mermaid on the front, a pair of  jeans, and pink socks.  So last night I helped her pack her backpack with the school supplies we just bought.  Of course, all the items that could be pink in color were pink! Upon completion of packing her backpack, I told her she had to start getting up early, so plenty of sleep is a must. This morning I didn't even have to wake her up, as her alarm went off and she hopped out of bed super excited for the big day. I went into her room and found she had dressed herself, and was just finishing putting on her shoes. ""Mom, today is my first day... i can't wait to make new friends!"" she said as we hurried into the car. We arrived a few minutes early so that I could help her find her classroom and her teacher. Mrs. Andrews was her name, and she greeted us with a huge smile and gave Maria a hug! Maria danced right into the classroom and found her seat at her new desk. I was so happy that she wasn't scared or nervous. She fit right in, and started talking to her classmates. I left and went home. Finally it was 2pm, and I raced to the school to pick her up. She came running up to my car with the biggest smile on her face. ""Mom! You're not going to believe how many new friends I have!

It seems like ages since I've been able to write anything but it's only been a few short months since the surgery to remove my spleen. Through it all I have the love of my life, my darling Charlene, to thank for her care and understanding. If you've never experienced what I have you probably won't understand but she was there when it happened, she was the one who insisted that I go to the hospital and it was her who cared enough to stay by my side night after night when things took a turn for the worse. It wasn't the surgery that laid me up but the complications caused by a negligent hospital staff and it was Charlene who rode their tails and saw to it that I received the follow up care I needed when things went side ways. So there I was, sitting on the sofa with my girl. We watching a movie on Netflix. I felt a stabbing pain in my back. Then I blacked out but it felt like I had just nodded off for a second. I woke up when Charlene started shaking me. She was upset. She knew before I did that things weren't right and before I could stop her she was already on the phone talking to my doctor. Next thing I know I'm in an ambulance racing through traffic with sirens blasting and lights flashing. They took me straight into the operating room and I woke up a few hours later with a 9 inch incision on my side where my spleen should have been. The first sign that something wasn't right was when I started trembling. I thought it was just a  chill but Charlene knew better.

3LBXNTKX0SH5BSPT6L7P3GNVQZY9XP,"A few months ago, I got married to my husband. However, the events leading up to the ceremony were pretty stressful. To start, the weather was lousy. We were having an outdoor wedding. It looked like it was going to rain, and it was already very windy. We were worried that some of the setup might just blow over from the wind. Also, we hit a lot of traffic going over to the venue, and I was already very stressed. My wedding dress also felt like it was not fitting right, even though it fit perfectly when I tried it on numerous times before. However, this could have been in my head, as I was already very stressed about the wedding and everything that was going on. It's not like I did not love my soon to be husband. Nor did I have second thoughts about it. On the contrary, I love him very much, and I was just looking forward to getting the ceremony started. When I finally walked down the aisle with my father and I saw my husband to be, I felt way better. Seeing him standing up there just seemed to alleviate all the stress. With that being said, the most surprising thing that happened was when the ring bearer tripped and fell. He quickly got up though, and he acted like nothing happened.

It’s often difficult, and sometimes it can even seem impossible, but in the long run, it’s more than worth it. When you need a favor, a landlord who likes you (like a trusted family member) can be a real lifesaver. Of course, that doesn’t mean you have to bake them cookies or mow their lawn. Just pay your rent on time, let them know immediately if you ever need a little more time to gather the money, and don’t make a habit of paying late. Beyond that, just make sure you know your landlord-tenant rights both locally and nationally, and your relationship should be easy-going and mutually beneficial. No matter where you live, specific rights apply to all tenant-landlord relationships, regardless of whether they’re spelled out in or omitted from your particular lease agreement. These include but are not limited to the right to receive police assistance in emergency situations free of charge, the right not to cover a landlord’s legal fees in the event of a dispute that ends up in court, and the prohibition of landlords from discriminating against prospective tenants on the grounds that they have children. Similarly, the law dictates that all tenants have a certain set of responsibilities inherent to their rental agreements. For instance, tenants are required to pay their rent in full on the day outlined in their lease. Tenants must use amenities like parking .lots and laundry rooms responsibly and without causing harm or destruction to them. Tenants are obligated to dispose of all waste materials such as car batteries, motor oil, and electronics in a safe and proper manner. It was a surprise encounter at just the right moment. It was good timing since I hadn't talked to my neighbor in a while before this. In addition, some states, counties, cities, and municipalities have laws and statutes in place that expressly prohibit tenants from participating in gang activity, physical assault, or the sale/purchase of illegal substances. Unlawfully using a firearm on the premises is another hard no. you feel like your rights have been violated, contact your local tenants’ rights organization for assistance. In the event that they agree that your rights may have been violated or that the landlord’s demands are illegal, seek legal assistance to determine your options. Ignoring disputes usually only escalates the problem and creates bad blood between you and your landlord .a situation that can seriously tarnish your peaceful home life. I have been in My apt I month and I have no hot water for three weeks what do I need to do. And everyday I call they tell me it will be on today.

3UOUJI6MTE03VKDW4W2GZCA85YUUXF,"For the past few years I've been considering taking some weaving lessons. Well, I finally got my chance to do so about four weeks ago. Unfortunately I greatly underestimated how much work would be involved. Before I did it I thought, ""Oh it's just weaving, how hard could it be?"" Pretty hard, it turns out. I went down to a local school here and managed to take lessons there, which lasted for a few weeks. During those lessons I was able to get some exposure to various types of weaving materials, which was nice. After a while I finally decided on attempting to create my own scarf. They're shaped very simply and don't involve too many types of fabric, so I figured that was a good starting point for projects. Overall the process wasn't too bad, but that yarn I used sure was a pain in the ass to work with. It was really thick and stiff, and kind of difficult to get into the right patterns for weaving. I kept at it and that perseverance and endurance carried me to the finish line, so to speak. Around the time that I finished the scarf there was a state fair taking place, so I decided to enter the scarf into a competition just for fun.

It was all perfect for a time. That is, until she got pregnant. Things took a dark turn when she got pregnant. I know that hormones can get pretty crazy, but let me tell you, crazy was a complete understatement. I was no saint. I knew nothing of how to deal with mood swings and hormonal imbalances. I would yell, get angry, and overall most of the time just make the situation worse. I never knew how to act almost. I did my best but my very best just wasn't good enough. She would yell constantly. And so would I. Fights were back and forth screaming matches. It got slightly better after the baby was born. I was finally a dad. We were finally a family together. Her and I split up a few months after the baby was born. It turned out that not everything was perfect sunshine and rainbows.

However, two weeks ago, I was blessed a whole week vacation to spend time with my family. I suggested we should go to the apple orchard that is half an hour away from us, and they all thought it was a great idea. I took them out to the apple orchard and it was a magnificent sight to look at. There was a bunch of bright, red apples everywhere and my kids were so excited that they ran with all their might to go touch the perfect red apples that not even Wholefoods may have. My kids saw a tall apple orchard in the distance and excitedly wanted me to grab the highest apple from the tree. Of course, I was reluctant about it because it was so high I can take a rocket ship.  My wife motivated me even further saying she would make lasagna this week, and that was all the encouragement I needed... apart from my kids of course. I took the ladder and positioned it at the tree. I looked up and I saw an apple calling for my attention. I knew right then and there that was the apple I needed in my life. I plucked it from the stem, but it took a great force to pluck it and the ladder wobbled. Had it not been my family, I would have fallen! Forget Marvel, my superheroes were my family that day. My family saw the apple and thought it was probably the apple that Snow White ate. We got so many apples. We were able to fill two buckets! After we plucked and sang, we did many other fun things. We played hide and seek in the orchard and that was fun because there were so many hiding spots to choose from! We may have accidentally squashed some apples as we ran but I apologized for it. It was a vacation we all needed. The business there allowed us to bake an apple pie from the apples we got, and I thought that was so amazing from their part; and we baked the most beautiful, delicious Apple pie that not even Gordon Ramsey can compete with.

This is exciting because we have been working on saying yes and no and understanding what these things mean. I asked her if she wanted some avocado. She usually loves to eat avocado. I expected a simple nod yes. Instead she goes, ""no thank you."" She has said yes and no and thank you separately already. However, she has yet to put it all together. We have prompted her a lot, guiding her to this. She finally understood and verbalized! I called Aaron over in hopes she would say it again and he could hear.

Raising a girl and being a woman myself, I am very aware of the risks she faces growing up in a society that views women as objects and does not necessarily respect us when we say no.

The next day when we woke up we had a nice breakfast cooked over the camp fire. It reminded me of my days in the boy scouts when I was young. After we cleaned up the mess we made by making breakfast we decided to head to the river. We also brought a kayak and paddle boards to enjoy our time on the river. I have never kayaked before, nor even seen a paddle board. I tried both and they were equally enjoyable. When I first got into the kayak it flipped over on me, we all laughed. Once I was able to turn the kayak back over and get back in we explored down the river. As we kayaked on the river there were many beautiful nature scenes we observed, it was very peaceful. Once we returned to the dock I tried to paddle board, it was really not as much fun as kayaking so I did not participate long. After several hours on the river we were all tired, and decided to pull the river toys out of the water and take a break.

We decided to have a fairly tame night out at a popular local bar with all our closest friends in attendance. It was a very cool night out compared to the hot weather we had been having. When we got to the bar we all played several rounds of pool and ordered several rounds of bourbon.  We had a lot of fun just sharing stories and playing games. It was such a memorable night due to the simplicity of it. We rarely all get together like that anymore and the focus was on having a good time. We had a pretty large bill by the end of the night and were entirely too drunk. I had to call a cab to get us all back to his apartment. From there we ordered a pizza and fired up some old games.  We must have played until at least five in the morning when the last of us had finally dozed off. The next day we were up early for the weeding and we had to scatter back to our places to get ready.  The wedding was was outdoors at a local winery.  It was such a nice morning and it felt good to breathe in the fresh air. The ceremony was simple and everyone was elated.

I was leaving work and the rain was coming down hard. I usually don't worry a lot about a little rain. However, while I had been working and not following the weather, there had been a lot of rain apparently. I ran from the building to my car, focusing on getting to the vehicle without getting my laptop wet and not really taking notice of the torrents of water pooling throughout the parking lot. I did notice that my shoes and clothes were soaked once I had reached the car. So, I drove from the lot and headed to my home that's just several miles away. I recall now driving through standing water on the road and shrugging it off as drainage issues. When I was close to home, I knew by this time that this rain was different. It was raining hard and not letting up. I couldn't see very well through the rain falling on the windshield. I contemplated pulling over but I was already so close to home. As I prepared to drive over a little bridge overpass, I felt my car being rocked a little. The car struggled for traction and I found myself being pulled off of the road by the rain runoff. I did the only thing I could think of, I exited my car and held onto a nearby tree. I watched as my vehicle and all my possessions inside it were swept over the bridge into the creek bed below. I waited in stunned silence until another driver spotted me and I climbed into their vehicle. I still can't believe this happened to me.

I am so happy that she was able to live out her bourgeois fantasy of having everyone show up to give her attention for getting married. I had such a good time and it made me love our culture. These are people who have absolutely no understanding of contemporary politics, all they know is Disney fantasies. It is good that they are able to shield themselves from reality.

3Z9WI9EOZ0AS6Y855EGSQ3DHCZ6KH7,Three months ago I helped my brother move into his college dorm room. I didn't realize how many emotions it would stir up from my old college days. When I moved into my dorm room I was so nervous about what my room mate would be like and how well we would get along. My brother on the other hand was excited at the thought of meeting someone new that he could possibly become life long friends with.  I saw my brother decorating his room and how much fun he was having doing. When I went to college I was so nervous and anxious that I didn't even think about what my decor would be. After he was done decorate his side of the room we decided to walk around campus to get a feel for how everything was. When we got to his cafeteria I have to admit I was a little bit jealous because the food variety was way better than what my school offered. As we toured the rest of campus together I looked around at all the other new freshmen and it brought back all those feelings of what I felt on my first day. I was a little sad after I realized college was so many years ago. Those were the days when I had so little responsibility. I remember thinking would I meet any cute guys. Would I make friends? I was scared of failing and letting my family down. Would I pick the right major? How would I know what major was right for me? Then I realized this wasn't about me but about my little brother. We walked back to his dorm and his room mate had showed up. I looked at him and I could see him beaming with the biggest smile. I knew he would be alright. I hugged him and told him I'll talk to him later and can't wait to hear how things went.,"I helped my brother move into college and the experience was nostalgic to me because I remembered moving myself 11 years ago.

I thought it would be a great idea to celebrate my birthday and the release show for my new album on the same day. It would be sort of a double celebration.

My assistant decided on Dade City High School as the school to visit.  She contacted the school and set everything up for me to come visit. When we arrived at the school, we checked in at the front office. I met the principal and he introduced me to the other people present in the office.  I signed autographs and took selfies with several of them.  Just as we were about to leave I heard this voice from behind me say, ""I always knew you were going to be a great musician."" I turned around and saw a familiar face.... it was Cynthia Ortiz! As I walked up to her, I saw her name badge read ""Assistant Principal"".  One of the secretaries asked, ""you two know each other?"" Cynthia quickly chimed in, ""yes we do.....me and this gentleman were high school sweethearts."" So that brings me up to tonight.

We headed back to the canyon and decided to check out a different section.  It is hard to describe how beautiful and big the Grand Canyon is.  There is an incredible view in every direction.

THe first thing he did was run around and lay in the grass in the sun. He was so cute. I love my turtle so much. He did meet this one kid who wanted to hold him. I asked his parents if it was okay and they said yes. So I let him hold him but then he dropped him. He dropped my baby turtle on the floor of that filthy airplane. I was so upset. Once we got to the hotel I gave him a bath immediately. He got so clean after that. I was so mad at that little brat. I don't know how brain dead you can be to drop a turtle but that was infuriating.

All I see around me is grey, no more trees, birds or even a sea breeze. Just cement and wires sticking out everything. As much as it make me happy to see my town progress into the future. I wish it could still hold onto some things from the past.  At least a few of the old characters are still around. I see what used to be my closest friend, still at his usual post. Playing cards on a milk crate behind the corner store. He's with some people I've never met. He spots me from across the road, and does a double take. I smile give him a wave, and he does the same. I ran across the street to say hello. He greets me with a big hug and we reminisce about the old days.

3H8DHMCCWAXBUI33JIX2ZIYJKT8KD1,"It was about six months ago when I had just gotten a new mountain bike so that I could ride some trails with my oldest son, who is 18. My son always loved mountain biking and was getting quite good at it. When I agreed to bike on some trails with him I was not sure what to expect, however I was excited to see what it's like. I knew how to bike quite well but I hadn't gone on any serious mountain bike trails yet. I remember when we arrived at the trail, he told me to follow him and that he would go slow. I was surprised how much stamina and focus it took to go down these trails right away but I kept up with my son at first. After a few minutes of going down the trail, however, my memory of the event gets hazy. What I do remember is that the trail started to feature these large jumps, and my son would back flip off every single one. So I figured since he's doing so many back flips, I would be able to do at least one pretty easily. The last I remember is getting so much air off the jump that I was headed straight into a river next to the trail. After that I don't remember anything until I woke up in the hospital, but my son tells me I performed a triple back flip off the biggest jump and landed straight in the river, and that he was able to get me out. But when he did, I apparently wasn't breathing, and thankfully he was CPR certified and was successful. Since then my memory has been pretty bad, I think I hit my head on a rock even though I was wearing a helmet. Since then I have been pretty terrified of biking at all.

He used to say that when he finally retired he would put away his work suit and put on his gardening rags. I always rolled my eyes, thinking if he really wanted to garden he'd make time for it in the present. But every time our family tour the nearby Botanical Gardens  I would see the longing on his face. The contentment he seemed to have when he'd bring home a plant he picked out, brought home and nurtured, then gave to a friend. Even though he's gone now, I want to feel closer to him.

I immediately knew that I had a serious injury. The pain shot up from my ankle area and I could no longer stand up.  A couple of my fellow players helped me to a bench and I sat down, hoping that it was just a sprain that would heal up with time and ice.  But it soon became apparent that I should probably get the thing looked at. I didn't think that I could drive with my injury, so I got a friend to drive me to the clinic,  The doctor told me I was in for a long recover. Bummer!

Everything was looking up and up ,  until i started dribbling the ball i felt pain above my heel. I couldn't stretch my ankle or stand on my toes. The pain was severe, and the area felt tender, stiff, and swollen. And i heard a popping noise when my achilles tendon was ruptured. I fell to the ground and i immediately held my knee. I felt that my soccer season was over and this was something serious. I tried to ice the area to keep the swelling down, but that was obsolete. I knew i had to go to the emergency room right away. At the hospital they confirmed that it was an achilles rupture, but instead of surgery i may need to wear a cast for six weeks. During this time the tendon will grow back together. The doctor had me in the cast and told me it will be changed every two to three weeks to help stretch the tendon. I have leg brace splint that keeps me from moving my foot to prevent further injury. After one week the doctor said it is ok to walk with the cast without putting too much pressure on it. Now i am two weeks into my post injury care and it seems to be healing as expected.

3WQ3B2KGE92G9KJXXC0EZDEK9KZ1BC,"3 months ago I was teaching math and science at my new job and I began noticing the way one of the children was being treated by a particular group of boys. This kid is Asian and the other boys were making comments about his race but it was obvious that they were mostly intimidated by him because he consistently outperformed them in the class. This boy was a excellent student in both math and science and and he was also getting all A's in his other classes . The boys that were picking on him spent much of the their time in class goofing around and it was a daily struggle to get them to do their work. There were 4 boys in particular that seemed to spend quite a bit of time together and not much was spent focusing on their school work. I began to notice that they would be especially disruptive and bully the boy when it was close to test time and I was working to prepare the class. It seemed that since they were not doing well in the class that they felt the need to disrupt the entire class and be especially mean to the boy that was leading the class. I began speaking to the boys individually about their behavior and tried to get them to see how they were behaving and to instead focus on their schoolwork. The asian boys parents came to talk to me about the behavior as their son was hurt by the way he was being treated. The parents said they were concerned and asked that the school discipline the group of boys that were bullying their son, I again spoke with the group of boys , mostly individually to let each of them know that they should be focusing more on their school work and that what they were doing was not kind and instead hurtful. I could tell they understood , some more than others at first but it seemed that this approach began to make a difference as I began noticing each of them become more thoughtful and less concerned about how much better the boy they were bullying was doing than them in the class. I began offering tutoring to anyone that wanted extra help and one by one each of the group of bullies began asking for help. They had become aware that they were jealous and simply needed to work harder. I noticed that he boys began to respect the asian boy and instead of being being negative they began to show interest in learning. It seems they realized that just because they were not as far behind as they felt and that if they just began working harder they too can understand mathematics and science. It was especially rewarding when it was time for the science fair and each one of the group of boys that began the year as bullies were instead some of the most excited in the class to participate in the science fair.",A kid was being bullied and I stepped up for the kid.

I didn't write about it when it happened because things were so busy then, but a couple of months ago, B&G stayed over with us for a week while their mother was recovering from surgery. John had to work, and he asked me if they could stay with us. I was kind of worried. Sure, John and Mary and the kids used to live next door to us (which is how John and I *ahem* connected), so the kids all knew each other, but it had been a couple of years since they split up and sold the house, and I wasn't sure how this would work. And Bobbie and Greta were kind of standoffish at first, and who could blame them? But Marcia and Jan were oblivious, thank heavens. They took B&G to the mall, and to the theme park, and they snuck around next door when the ""new"" neighbors weren't home and peeked through the windows, which must have been weird for B&G. Their old place has changed -- a lot -- and they were pretty quiet that night. John came over every evening after work, which is *not* normal, and that was tense at first because it's not normal, but it got better. Mainly, I was glad to see M&J reconnect with their old friends. After a while, it was like one long sleepover. By Saturday, they'd run out of things to do, and G&B were due to go back home on Sunday, so we just stayed around the house. John was at Mary's, making sure she was ready to take back the kids, so it was just us girls. It was a warm, still summer evening, and we went out back after supper to sit on the porch. When the fireflies started to come out, Bobbie and Greta squealed like eight-year-olds, not the teens they are now, and asked if I had any bottles. Apparently there aren't lightning bugs where they live now. I found four bottles -- some glass, some plastic -- and watched in bemusement as all four girls ran around collecting fireflies. It was like a last hurrah for childhood, and I was as glad for those two girls as I was for my own daughters. And now we go forward. M&J have apparently been texting G&B, and G&B are working on John (and on Mary, too, I guess). They all want to get together again before graduation.

I fear that if I don't write it down soon I may not believe it myself in another 1/4 of a year. As you might know, there are no leash laws in my community. The neighborhood dogs tend to spend the days visiting each other and ... being dogs. Most of them go back to the particular human family that ""owns them"" at night to be fed and cared for, but there are always a few that don't seem to belong to anyone in particular and just sort of make the rounds between a few different homes. Well, my wife stumbled on a post on facebook that a local stray who we had always called Rufus had been taken into the pound by animal control. He had been found under a nearby house when the homeowners investigated the source of a whimpering noise they had been hearing for a few days. Apparently there was a thorn in his foot that had become badly infected, and these people (not having money for veterinary care, nor desiring to have a dog) had him taken to the shelter. Well, I had always been rather fond of Rufus in passing. So when my wife suggested we cover the cost of his antibiotics and adopt him I agreed. A couple weeks of healing and good food and he was back to his rascally good nature. However, now that we ""owned"" him on paper problems began to arise. You see, my wife and I live on the edge of town and coyotes live in the valley below us. They don't really cause any trouble in town, but they are the reason that most farmers in the area have a dog to scare them away from livestock. It used to be that when the coyotes would start ""singing"" at night several of the town dogs would ""rap battle"" right back. A territory thing I suppose ... Well, Rufus in particular had always seemed to see it as part of his oikos to protect the smaller dogs and bark loudly to keep the coyotes at bay. Nobody ever seemed to mind, but once he became ""our"" dog that changed. Neighbors began to call the police with noise complaints. They demanded that we keep him in the house at night. Now, he was a very sweet dog, obedient to many commands like sit, shake, Eskimo Kiss, etc. but being rather a free spirit the one thing he would not do is come when he was called. He would come close enough to ""check in"" but not quite into arms reach until he was good and ready. Well, after a few more exchanges with the cops we started keeping him tied up with a cable when he went out so we could make sure that he came inside at night. Well, one night the local pack of coyotes were raising a right ruckus.

By the time Fisher got in her yellow Volkswagen, the sky had transformed again: It was somehow both shrouded and glowing. Many other residents had learned to keep a “go bag” packed by the door, with water, medications and copies of important documents; a woman from the local Fire Safe Council, a volunteer known affectionately as the Bag Lady, held frequent workshops demonstrating how to pack one. But Fisher was indecisive and moving inefficiently. It had taken her nearly 40 minutes to commit to leaving, wrangle the dogs and scramble to grab a few haphazard possessions. It was now 8:45. So many calls were being placed to 911 that a dispatcher interrupted one man reporting a fire alongside Skyway Road — the busiest street in Paradise and the town’s primary evacuation route — with a terse, “Yeah, sir, we have fire everywhere.” Officials had started issuing evacuation orders about an hour earlier; Fisher’s neighborhood was among those told to clear out first. Her street was plugged with cars. A thick line of them crept forward at the end of her driveway. There are five routes out of Paradise. The three major ones spread south like the legs of a tripod, passing through the heart of town and continuing downhill toward Chico and the valley below. Fisher lived in the northern part of town, on the easternmost leg of the tripod, Pentz Road; she rented a bedroom from a woman who worked at a nursing home in town. It baffled her to see that all the cars in front of her house were heading north on Pentz, cramming themselves away from the center of Paradise, away from the valley, and further uphill. The opposite lane, meanwhile, was totally empty. It seemed obvious to Fisher that, if the fire was approaching from somewhere in the canyon behind her house, there would be plenty of Paradise left in which to safely wait it out. So she pushed across the traffic, into the empty lane. But she barely went 100 yards before a driver sitting in the jam alongside her rolled down his window and explained that Pentz was blocked up ahead.","I traveled from North Carolina to California by car for a week long road trip.

To be honest the best part was that he included my step dad and they also bonded as well. I honestly don't think I could have asked for a better weekend that that, and to share it with two people that care about me was the icing on the cake.

I tried to improve my voice over the course of time but there was nothing I can do about it. Instead of trying to force my weight around, I resigned. I didn't want to, but I don't think I had much of a choice. As it turns out, there was significant blockage. This blockage took place in my saliva gland, and that caused me to lose my voice. I never knew such a thing was even possible. Then again, my scientific background isn't exactly sparkling. I just wanted to be there for everyone, but I needed to take care of myself. Most of my job required talking, so not being able to talk was going to cause issues. It took a while for me to admit a problem. But, I also didn't want to have the workforce lag behind.

So being able to be with them all again for my aunt and uncle's anniversary was wonderful. We spent the week exploring the city and seeing everything that Boston had to offer. We went to the harbor, ate at a lot of restaurants, went on the duck boats, and just enjoyed being with family. This was the most fun I had had in a long time. Finally, the week came to an end and we all had to say goodbye to each other. We promised that not as much time would pass until the next time that we saw each other again.

I talked to my husband and we decided to use the money to take a rare trip home to visit my parents.  Since moving to California I don't get back to the Midwest often to see them.  It was during the summer when we visited .  The weather was hot but cool in the evenings.  We spent our days having nonstop fun and taking in some of the local areas that I had not visited since I was a young child.  We enjoyed evenings sitting outside by their fire pit.

To start with my relaxing morning I drew a bath with a bath bomb I'd been saving for such an occasion. The water was nice, warm and smelled delightful. I soaked for about 30 minutes. After my bath I looked around the house and realized it was a mess. To put my mind at ease I start tiding up and deep clean a good portion of my apartment. Now that my home looked as good as I felt, I began to get dressed to go to eat. I had given Mel a call to meet me there and she agreed. Feeling good and looked even better I grabbed my keys and went off. I finally get to the restaurant and I sit there wait for Mel to arrive. She texted me and said that she was gonna be a little late due to an accident on the freeway. I go ahead and order some coffee and a pastry while I wait. To get myself ahead in work for the following week, I respond and plan with client's requests and answer any questions they might have. As I'm sitting there typing, I notice a man checking me out from a couple tables in front of me. I looked over and it was clear to me that he wasn't my type. As I looked we had a split second of eye contact. He smiles and approaches me at the table. As he's walking up to the table, I desperately grab my phone and continue replying to clients. He looks at me and asks if I wanted to go out sometime. I tell him no. He makes another attempt and again I reject him. He gets frustrated and completely goes off. He goes on and calls me a bitch making a scene in the whole restaurant. He starts using racial slurs and tells me that I'm not pretty enough for him because of it.

We had great family time and saw family that live so far from us, we hardly ever get together.  It was like a big family reunion!  One night I just really wanted to get out and have some fun.  It had been all family time and with the children.  I just needed a break from the kids.  I talked my sister and several of my female cousins into going out on the town for the night.  We left our husbands and kids behind and bar hopped several places.  We drank more than we should and danced inappropriately, but hey!  Everyone needs to get out at some point.  This was my night.  It was the best time I had had in awhile, and I realized that I need to take more time for ""me"".","My nephew was getting married so my family and I drove from North Carolina to Florida for the wedding.

Her mum stays in a more colder region so we also got ourselves some sweatshirts and cardigan. We got her mum a birthday present also. It was a food processor. We had a smooth flight down and we were well received by those already there. The mum was particularly happy as its been a while we saw last. We settled in my girlfriend's room and the whole family had a great dinner together. I was able to bond well with the family as we shared our experiences with anxiety and depression. My girlfriend felt I talked too much but I made her understand it was because I felt at home. We argued before going to bed and when we woke on the next day. I was furious as it was her mum's day and I dont like the fact that she is ruining it already. She later calmed down and apologized.

I had been moved into the math department due to a lack of funding. I was desperate to get back into the science department. I was licensed to teach both subjects, but I hated math. And more importantly, my students hated math. I figured if I could pull off the olympiad event I might make a good impression on the superintendent. I started getting everything together and realized it was going to be a lot of work. I had to get enough kids to participate, get parents to help, and get donations. I was doing pretty well and then I got a phone call that the school had decided to include the younger grade levels as well. All the work I had just done had to be redone, and at three times as much. Somehow I managed to pull it off. The event went perfectly, the kids all had fun. I looked really good and I was anxious to see if the SUperintendent would notice. The next day at school I was immediately called into his office. He was so impressed with my organization that he decided I belonged in the science department!

He happens to have an entire cultural background that is just not much practiced by him but his parents do. He's from a pretty religious background but isn't all that religious these days. Regardless, at around 12PM we would have the traditional ceremony, and then again at around 3PM we would have the normal wedding. We live in a small town or smallish city really so this was all rather exciting for my friends and family. He dressed in traditional robes and we had a change of clothes. What was amazing is that everyone observed the singing, the use of sand and glass to make the gestures that were required and just altogether made that ceremony amazing. We had some drinks and lunch at around 2 and at 3PM again we congregated at a church for my traditional ceremony. My partner looked handsome in his suit and everything was perfect. The priest was hilarious and cracked jokes the entire time, making everyone laugh and feel comfortable. At the reception we took photos and performed our unexpected first dance, breaking it down hiphop style to some 2pac. Everyone loved it. We laughed, and ate the delicious food, including some traditional malay type food which my partner hadn't had in forever but everyone really enjoyed. As the evening wore on we drank beers and wine and got a little too silly. We managed to get back to our hotel late, nearly 2 AM and we crashed in a heap on the bed.

I mean, who can stay depressed when you have all of that kitten energy going on in your life?  I loved her so much.  When I would go through a hard day she was always there to make me feel better.  I first noticed her not feeling well about a year ago.  I took her right to the vet.  At first, they gave her some medicine and told me to watch her.  I was anxious at first but then I was elated that she started to get better.  But it didn't last long.  After an initial uptick in health, it took a bad turn for the worse and I could see tumors forming.  I panicked and took her in.  I didn't have the money for the vet so I put it on a credit card and I felt thankful to have good credit so I could help her.  I paid for a biopsy of the tumors.  The biggest moment of this experience was when the vet asked me to come in to hear the results instead of giving me the results of the biopsy over the phone.  At this moment I felt so anxious and I knew it was bad news.  When I came in they said that she had a very aggressive form of feline cancer.  Her chances, especially at her age, were not good.  Chemo treatments would cost thousands, be very painful and probably would not work.  I hated that I was considering money as one of the factors.  I didn't have thousands and it looked like it would not work.  I mean, if this was my child and it kind of is, I would say that I didn't want to pay the moeny.  In the end the doctor helped me by recommending to put her to sleep which I did.  After I oddly felt at peace knowing that she lead a good life and was no longer in pain.","I had to have my cat put to sleep.

I’ve always seen myself in the small, upscale neighborhood of Isle but didn’t know if I would be able to afford it after college. I learned about Isle when I visited a childhood friend of mines new home when I was in high school. The neighborhood is located on the coast of one of the Great Lakes and embodies perfect coastal town charm. Because the homes here have beachfront property, I knew it would be expensive to move here. I made a plan during my sophomore year of college to move to the town. I started by narrowing down jobs that I could apply for close to the town that would allow me to make money. Once I located a couple of businesses that I’d be happy to work for, I started researching internships that I could take during the summer between semesters.  Next thing I knew I was applying and interviewing for the internships. I had hoped that these would help me get a foot in the door. I was lucky enough to land one of the internships I wanted. So for the next three years, I did the absolute best I could in classes. I studied hard and made sure to take each course seriously. During the summers, I interned for the same company in hopes that I would receive a job offer. It was getting towards the end of my internship during my senior year and I still didn’t have an offer. I started to worry that maybe I hadn’t done enough. In fact, I got so much anxiety I called my parents every night to talk to them and have them reassure me that things would work out. And they were right, just one week before my final internship ended, my supervisor sat me down and offered me a job. While I kept it calm on the outside, on the inside I was screaming with excitement. I accepted the job and began looking for a place to live in my favorite neighborhood of Isle.

When people judged her, she challenged them to think harder and be more critical. She changed my entire life really. She is the one that told me to question everything. That I can only know what I've experienced myself. That so many people in life just follow the person in front of them, and never really know what it is like to live. They don't even know themselves. She challenged me to become a more well rounded person. To think outside of myself and care about other people. She showed me that living a truly fulfilling life meant learning about myself and what I care about and then sharing that with the world. It was about helping other people.

Thankfully, a nearby hiker heard my cries for help and carried me to the nearest medical center. I got helicoptered to a local hospital and found out I had a broken my left leg and also torn my meniscus. I was so heartbroken when the doctor told me I would need extensive physical therapy before I could return to biking. By the time I had gotten the diagnosis, my best friend had shown up and was there to comfort me. She promised she would help me every step of the way with recovering. At first, when I had been discharged and brought back to my city, I was so discouraged. Even standing up was a grueling experience and physical therapy was one of the most painful things I had ever gone through. I was ready to give up everyday, but my best friend always sent me motivational texts, accompanied me to therapy, and pushed me to do the exercises on my own day after day. Though I was struggling, I can't say I ever felt alone because of her. It has now been a little over 4 months since the incident and I just got back from my follow-up appointment.

The next morning I woke up feeling a little weird, not exactly sick, but not myself either. I decided to skip breakfast that morning before heading off to work because of the way I was feeling, and because I'm not a big breakfast eater anyway. Things went downhill from there. I had no appetite that day, but decided not to force myself to eat, thinking that my appetite has to come back eventually. I was wrong. The day after that I felt worse, and again didn't eat. After the third day with no appetite, I decided to make an appointment with my doctor. She ran some tests and asked me what medications I was taking. To my surprise, she told me that not having any appetite for a few days is not all that unusual. She did list some pretty scary things that could be causing my lack of appetite, but said she didn't think it was anything serious. She told me to try to force myself to eat, and to come back in a couple of days if there was no improvement. Well, I tried to do what she said, but I just couldn't make myself eat, because I couldn't even stand the sight of food at that point, and  I missed my appointment with her two days later because I just didn't feel like leaving the house. The next day I began to feel faint. My sister-in-law was with me because she had heard I wasn't feeling well and had come by to check on me. She immediately suggested we go to the emergency room. After seeing how pale and weak I was, they decided to admit me right away. After being admitted, I spent three days in the hospital and they ran more tests, but still couldn't determine the reason for my lack of appetite. In the hospital, they had me on an intravenous drip, and were somewhat successful in getting me to eat a little. Also, while in the hospital they put me on medication to increase my appetite.

When I graduated from high school, I had no idea what to do with my life.  I took a job at a local diner frying up greasy food for obnoxious drunks and others, but the pay was poor and I was tired of living in my hometown.  I desired adventure.  I enlisted because someone told me that I could travel around the world and get paid good money and benefits without a college degree.  To make a long story short, the Army was no picnic.  I did my four years and decided to leave.  Don't get me wrong, I gained a lot in the military, but it didn't fit my personality.  I figured I'd take the money that I received for college and get that degree that I'd been avoiding.  Unfortunately, things didn't work out the way that I had hoped.  College wasn't for me either, so I dropped out after a series of failing grades and lack of interest in a major.  The college money from the military, as well as my savings,quickly ran out.

Moving away from my hometown was a crazy change, and it's hard to believe I actually went through with it. Most people don't. Ultimately though I was just too bored in my hometown. Seeing the same friends at the same places while drinking and eating the same things just grows so tiresome. At least for me anyway. It was my snoozefest of a desk job that forced me to pack up and head across the country for a new life, but the dull familiarity of the area was a big reason too. I needed a change in the worst way. I probably should give myself more credit for actually pulling such a change off too. Even if that change means starting at the bottom at a new job and living in a tiny apartment. But it's new and it's fresh, and that's the significant part. I have a whole new area to explore here out west, and the weather here makes back home feel like Russia. I know some of my friends are already thinking about coming to visit for a weekend or so. In a way I don't want them out here, but I would certainly like to see them eventually.

I realize compared to the risk of riding in a car the chance of a crash happening is statistically lower, but not in my opinion. I do not think something that size has any business being in the air and basically propelled by fire. This is all beside the point because three months ago I had no choice but to get on a plane to attend my company's annual event. This year it was at the state's capitol. I'm glad it doesn't take place at the same location every year, so that's a positive aspect. I rarely visit the capitol so at least a bit of excitement was added to the mandatory plane trip. I would have preferred at least one night's stay in a decent hotel instead of having to fly back on the same day. That is way too much flying for me and maybe even most people. It felt like a waste of resources and there could have been a better, less wasteful alternative to the entire event. It's difficult to say whether or not I had a good time considering I spend the entire day being anxious about traveling on two different airplanes.

Its a shame I spent years around these people, and I can not tell you one thing about any of them(aside from my marching crew). After all, most of them did not seem very friendly or open to conversation. Even in college it was common to see cliques(which was something I thought ended after high school). On most days, I felt like an outsider and like I was merely existing while at Harvard. There was one thing that made me feel wholeness and like I belonged, and that was the marching band. I did not speak to many people while on the marching band crew, but we connected through our instruments and music. The members of my marching crew were very similar to me. Many of them did not talk a lot, and came to achieve greatness and do what they love just like me. I knew from the beginning that is where I was supposed to be. Although my days at Harvard are now a memory, I learned a lot about myself and the way of the world. Without my Harvard experience, I would not be half the person I am today.","On the day of my graduation from Harvard I felt a wide range of feelings, from regret of not knowing my classmates well to absolute belonging when I was with the marching band.",90.0

Which is why i started to run in the morning. The wind, the mist, the people.. It has always been interesting. I was out on my usual run this morning. I met this happy camper on the way. He was tall, with a long beard. He was attractive too. He had a sense of wisdom about him, far beyond his age. We got to talking.

Our families notoriously hated each other, so I guess this was her attempt at an olive branch. At first I wasn't going to go. But then I talked it over with my mother and she thought it would be a good idea to attend. She said when I was younger Anna and I were very close and that Anna probably missed me. I sent the RSVP back saying I would attend with my boyfriend. I was pretty nervous walking into the reception. I hadn't seen many of these relatives in at least 5 years. Some of them had big fights with my mother. I wasn't sure what everyone thought of me. I quickly found my seat and sat down so I could observe the room. I noticed right away that everyone was drinking heavily. I figured it was in my best interest to stay sober. The night proceeded without any issues. I talked to my cousin, it was great to see her.

Several weeks ago I had hated talking about mushrooms that make you feel wonderful, they make you use sub-regional things while transporting you for a period of time to a parallel world where you are the King. When I heard it, I felt very intrigued and excited about how it was or how I felt trying these substances and experiencing their effects on me. Until I found a person I recommended that if I was going to do it I needed to drink orange juice and chocolate in case that as they say my ""trip"" is not as good as expected. I dared to do it I went and bought the mushrooms and apart from that a lot of chocolate and orange juice to prevent things from going wrong, I came to my house and turned on the stove I boiled water and prepared a magic tea with psilocybin mushrooms. I was very excited to know what effects it would have on my body, after the tea was ready I sat in my chair, and for a few minutes while I waited for it to cool a little, I thought about my life, and how crazy it is to do this to Conventional people like most people in the world. After a few minutes that my cold cooled, I drank it almost completely, while I could feel it, the effects were beginning to emerge on my body, and when I finished almost completely my tea, I had the best and craziest experience in my lifetime. I left my apartment and headed with the effects of mushrooms to a park, and I could see everything with sharpness and colors too bright, people looked different than I usually see them. There was happiness everywhere, then further steps I could see a tree with violet leaves was something incredible, everything was so colorfully beautiful. Without a doubt I could enjoy that experience to the fullest after this, I began to feel a little dizzy and uncoordinated it was there when I knew that I had to do something to stop the effect, unfortunately I had to say goodbye to that colorful and beautiful city and see again The somber city of always. I ate chocolate with a good glass of orange juice and the effects started to go down, but something unexpected happened when the effects were removed and it was that my eyes opened and I managed to see and understand the good things of the world, the good things of me .I understood at that moment that this was my true self, a happily crazy person who lived submerged in a world of complete happiness and total freedom. It should be clarified that before, when I was a little younger, I suffered a lot of contempt from my friends at school, this brought to my life what they read now, an even better person, freed from any external opinion other than mine.

Autumn was gradually turning into winter, and we were looking for something fun to do, as a family. But this was a special occasion, because my mom was in town, and I hadn't seen her in 2 years. Her health had been poor as of late, but new physical therapy brought life back into her body movement and spirit. So, she was looking to visit and see her family. She flew in the day before, and brought love and excitement into the occasion. My kids, ever excited to see grandma, and find something fun to do, began listing all their ideas. Jack, my son, screamed, ""beach,' and Joan, my daughter, yelled, ""fair!"" We all agreed, based on weather, that the fair was the best idea, so, we packed up the car, and trekked out into town, where the fair was located. Typically, Im not too keen on fairs; its always so noisy, sometimes dirty, and for some reason I always get the cold/flu there. Nonetheless, my opinion was not important, because this was about family and magic, so we got our tickets at the booth, and began perusing all the attractions. The kids went on the Whirly Wheel first, and my wife tried the Cup Shooting (she won a giant penguin for my daughter). It was during this time that I was able to take a few minutes to chat with my mom face to face; it was nice to see her, see her up and moving. It was at this moment my mom told me she hadn't been on a carousel in 60 years, since she was a child. So we got on together, she sat on a pink horse, and I stood beside her for physical support. The music began and we began to whirl, the light in her eyes was palpable. It was life a flashback to her childhood; it was truly a magical moment. Afterwards, we joined together again, and went off the concession stand. The kids had never had fried dough, so we got three big plates full, and indulged. They filled their mouths as they listened to the sights and sounds around them.  ""This place is magical, Dad,"" Joan yelled. ""Ya! Im glad we didnt go to the beach!"" Fireworks erupted overhead.

Much to my luck, when I got there, I almost instantly found a few people who were in the same situation I was and we bonded instantly. As we floated down the river, swapping stories and kicking back beers, our group grew larger and larger. It got to the point where we were floating in a big group of about a dozen people. We were from all walks of life and we would have never met or interacted in any other setting. Everyone had a unique life experience and we all enjoyed each other’s company and stories. We would stay up all night talking about our lives, what led us here, what we hope the future brings, and shared some of our fondest memories from growing up. This group of people were amazing, and I am so happy I was able to meet them. The weather on the trip was perfect so I was able to relax with my new friends without having to worry about the conditions too much. As it turns out, a few of the people I met were from the city I was moving to, so I made sure to get their contact info. I even met a really cute girl who I made plans with meeting up with once I got to the city and settled in.

There was an overflowing dumpster and a bad smell but I still let him push me against the wall and kiss me.

She knows I'm not much of a hiker but she insisted we go anyways. I was completely out of breath and exhausted but I wanted to look cool in front of her so I didn't say anything. We got to a point on the hike where the trail was extremely narrow and parallel to a cliff side. Me, wanting to look cool, thought it'd be a good idea to attempt to cross while making a very obvious point not to use my hands to hold onto the wall next to the path. Obviously this had the negative effect you would have imagined, and I slipped. I was dangling off the edge of the drop. It wasn't a very big drop, probably like 8 or 10 feet, but definitely high enough that I would have probably broken an ankle if I wasn't prepared.

You can either be sentimental or funny..... To decide which is best, consider the bride and what she would likely prefer. It can depend on the tone of the wedding as well. Edit the templates using Adobe Reader. Fill your own information in with the details requested between the brackets to personalize the speech you select. A funny speech, like the one in the template to the right, is perfect if the bride has a great sense of humor and some cute quirks she wouldn't mind you sharing with everyone. For example, you could share a couple silly stories about how the bride likes cheese snacks dipped in dressing or that as a child, she tried to make toast in a VCR. The silliness continues as you share a couple impersonal dating tidbits and how you knew it was different with the groom. Pick this speech template if you know the bride wouldn't mind a few chuckles at her expense..........    This speech is written from the perspective of a sister who has a strong bond with the bride. The speech discusses their upbringing, recalls a childhood story or two, and talks about how growing up with this sister is entirely unique. The groom is casually mentioned and included as an integral part of the speech. His part in this speech is being welcomed to the family and the chaos you often go through.

But that's probably how they get you. A few months back I signed up for a lottery ticket. I bought it, and didn't really give it a second thought until weeks later. As it turns out, I had actually pulled a ticket that was worth a lot of money. So much so that it helps with bills. It was something I certainly didn't expect. I think it's best to approach it casually. Those who are avid goers risk a lot. It's not fair, but that's inherent to the game. It's fun, but high risk.

It’s the first engagement of all the cousins on my mom’s side — granted, there are only two cousins outside of myself, my brother and my sister. Still, it’s enough to be hot, hot family news and send us into a collective, year-long planning mode: How do we get to the wedding, what do we wear to the wedding, where do we stay for the wedding, what do we do before and after the wedding? The wedding becomes what we plan our lives around. It’s not that we’re crazy, wedding-obsessed people. It’s that my cousin’s wedding is in Shanghai, China. Both of my parents are from Shanghai. Most of my mom’s family is still in Shanghai, and my cousin who is getting married lives with my aunt and my uncle and my grandmother in the same house that my mother grew up in as a child. My family also lived in Shanghai for nearly two years when I was around 8 and 9 years old, and visited again a year later. But I had not been back since. And not only had I not been back, but in that 13-year separation, I had forgotten the bulk of Chinese I had ever known how to speak. Instead of focusing on re-learning the language in the year I had, I shoved it to the bottom of my mental to-do list. By the time December 2012 rolled around, I was no better at remembering how to say “Where is the bathroom?” than 12 months earlier. When we finally arrived in Shanghai, the reality of being in China’s largest city began to settle in. On the streets, taxis weaved in and out of lanes, miraculously avoiding crashes by near inches. People crowded the sidewalks, pushing others to get by and rushing across busy streets, also miraculously avoiding getting hit by cars. Buses honked. Street vendors hollered. We spent a day getting over the jet lag before the wedding. We saw my cousin and the rest of the family. We ate a lot of food in a short amount of time. And to be honest, by the morning of the wedding day, I wasn’t too worried about not being able to speak Chinese.

From straightforward assignments like sitting up or lifting their head to more progressed developments like rolling over, these small accomplishments are continuously inspiring. But there’s nothing very like seeing your baby crawling for the primary time. Many guardians are on edge to see their child crawl and closely screen their baby’s improvements. Of course, there’s completely nothing off-base with that! In any case, it’s vital to keep in mind that all babies are diverse and take after a distinctive advancement path.

38YMOXR4MVL349I5Y98RHNIMQAU6WJ,"Dear Diary, It's been one month since I started my new job. The process was so tedious, but I'm so excited I finally got the job. Now that the excitement has worn off though, I'm feeling a little bored. I'm starting to understand why the work pays so well. It's just so repetitive! If I didn't need the money so badly, I'd hand in my resignation tomorrow! I can't wait to look for something new. Still I'm afraid of looking for another job, because I may not find something as well paying as this one. Additionally, I know it looks super bad on a resume to skip out on a job after only a month! I honestly wish I had read more reviews on this job before I applied. The interview process was so long as well! It took almost a month for me to receive a formal job offer! That seems insane right? I know a lot of companies take that long, but with a company turn over this high, you'd think they would've been able to move it along a little faster. I remember going to the first interview, almost dying from nervousness! I wondered at the time if my boss could see it, and that seemed to make me even more nervous. I actually had to hold my leg down to keep it from shaking because when I get nervous that tends to happen. I guess it most not have bothered him too much since I got the job. I was only made more nervous not to get a formal job offer and be strung along for weeks.  Anyway, I'll try to stick this out for awhile and build up some savings so I can look for something else.

I've ceased dreaming and now know only the nightmare of little to no food, warmth, or affection, and all I can feel is fear. I don't understand why this happened to me.

Many of my friends from high school are still living there and I made plans to get together for a Yankees game with some of them. The evening we choose to see the game was a beautiful night. The temperature was unseasonable hot so nobody has to wear a jacket. There was also not a cloud in the sky so the views of Yankee Stadium were just amazing! It had been such a long time since I had the chance to be there that I had forgotten how truly stunning Yankee Stadium is on its own. Since we got there early we decided to get some delicious ball park franks along with nachos! No matter how our tastes change over the years one thing that never can be topped is Yankee Stadium's food. Just smelling it brought back memories of visiting the old Yankee Stadium with my family. Most of us went ahead and got some beers with the food. Although some of us with more sensitive stomachs decided to opt for soda instead. We took all of our snacks up to the bleachers and found our seats. Hanging out together as some music was playing and people were slowly filling in the stands was an amazing aspect of the evening. It just made everything seem so much fun and we all found each other's company so relaxing. Finally as the stadium filled up the Boston Red Sox team were introduced as the visitors, to many boos from the audience. We all settled in to watch the Yankees win. Much to our dismay the Yankees ended up losing the game. None of us were very happy with the outcome of the game but we all did end up enjoying the evening together very much and hope to be able to repeat it soon. Looking back I really do feel like the highlight was just spending time with old friends and reconnecting with them.","We ate ballpark food.  We drank a little beer and soda. The best part was getting together. We talked about old times.  What surprised me was we all had  a good time even though our team lost.The night was pleasant, not too hot,  very clear.",90.0

It was one of the craziest weekends of my life so far. It was a Saturday afternoon, and I went to an all day CHIRP radio station event at the House of Vans in Chicago, CHIRP stands for the Chicago Independent Radio Project, Nikki does some volunteering there. Anyway she was working a table and there were a few bands and DJs playing. I was off dancing and watching the music while she was handing out information for the radio station and selling some records. Apparently there was a drunk guy who kept sitting on the table she was working, right on top of the records Nikki tried to ask him to move but he wasn’t listening so she yelled at him, the guy turned around and slapped her in the face and ran off laughing. Nikki was absolutely beside herself so she came to find me and she pointed him out, I told her to go get security while I kept an eye on him and called the police. The guy tried to make a break for it when we approached him but we were able to block his exit long enough for the police to get ahold of him. We spent a long time filing a police report and winding down. Nikki didn’t want to be in Chicago anymore at that point, she needed a break and was shaken up, so we made the hour and a half drive north to Milwaukee. It was starting to get later into the evening and I asked if she wanted to just relax and watch TV. She said she wanted to be around people but someplace bright and not at a bar. We went to a nice bright sushi restaurant and had dinner but after that I wasn’t really sure where to take her, I usually hang out in dark places. On a whim I suggested we go to the Potawatomi casino thinking she wouldn’t go for it as neither of us are big gamblers, but surprisingly Nikki was up for it and we went. We gave ourselves a $20 limit each and lost all that money disturbingly fast, I suppose that’s how it usually goes. So we decided to get another $10 and just play the penny slot machines to kill time. We were chatting away and playing slots, getting the weirdness of the day behind us. I was getting down to my last few pennies and I wasn’t really paying attention to what I was doing when the slot machine started going nuts — I had won the jackpot! $79,502! Well half that after I split the jackpot with Nikki. We had some drinks at the bar and went home to crash and In the morning I took Nikki to the train station to catch the Hiawatha train back to Chicago and then met my Mom downtown for lunch at the Comet Cafe. I told her about my crazy day and in typical Mom fashion she told me that gambling is dangerous and I shouldn’t do it. Oh well, she didn’t complain when I paid for lunch though.",I went to a local meetup from the radio station. Ended up at a casino and won a jackpot. Then I went out with my mom for lunch.,90.0

My job has been a total disappointment, I feel like I'm getting no where and my boss really treats me disrespectfully.  I am just working to get by and pay the bills. I've tried to figure out something I can do to help the community and also satisfy my budget needs.  After talking to a career counselor, I've decided to get my TEFL certification. I feel like this will make a big difference in my life.  I enrolled last month and am going to be starting my first class in a week. I am a little nervous to be making such a big change in my life, but I am optimistic that this will be a better change for me. The course will be taken at the Daytona State College which is not too far from my house.  I also think I may sign up for a couple of extra curricular activities.  Some of the groups include helping immigrants settle in their new lives in America. I will be helping to navigate around the city. Showing how to use the bus system and make local appointments and shop in the main stores in the area. I also get to help plan parties and celebration in honor of our new friends.

My cousin has always been kind of a problem drinker and we all hoped he would control himself this time. This was not the case. The day started out great. A lot of catching up and laughs. It was around lunch time and we all decided to get something to eat. A few others had a drink, nothing unusual, but my cousin went overboard.

I was so nervous but the vet was calm so I tried to be as well.  They gave me several meds for him.  The vet did not know what caused the episode so that has me worried.

Then, about five months ago, it happened. One of my team members did something that ended up getting him sent to our HR department. Though I didn't know at the time, this person supposedly viewed adult content on his work computer during work hours. This was strongly against company policy and met with zero tolerance. Despite pleading his case and begging to stay, this employee was terminated the following day without a fair hearing. I felt like I knew this person fairly well and didn't believe he would do this, so I began to investigate. After speaking with our IT department and correcting a rare error on their end, I came to a startling conclusion. My co-worker had been unfairly fired and absolutely deserved his job back! It was another co-worker who had viewed the adult material instead. Despite feeling bad about what I would have to do, I went in and spoke to my boss to correct the issue. He was shocked and felt terrible about the mistake. He then called the terminated employee and offered him his old job back and a raise because he felt so bad.

I've always felt like I had a good grip on the games education, work, and in my personal life.  Holiday parties are usually boring and mundane but I knew this would be different because of the expanded invitation list.  It was my 5th wedding anniversary and was also a combination party for the 4th of July.  The list included family, neighbors and many of my old friends who happened to be in the area this time of year. I thought it would be great to reconnect with many old acquaintances and friends and catch up with them and reminisce about old times and what's been going on with their lives.  I have been a good been a good pen pal (old school) with many of them so I kind of understand where they are at in their life.  Now I get to see the fruits of their labors -  their wives and their children have come here in full knowledge of having a great time.  They came and they arrived in droves and caravans.  The pavilion tent was set up and the catering was in place.  The chairs and tables were set up picnic style and everyone took their place.  This was by far the biggest party I've ever thrown.  Conversations were amazing, the details were vivid and the stories of the past just kept rolling off like a waterfall.  It was at this time I realized that the things that I thought were important Lake success at work and amount of money that I had in the bank were just a part of my life, they shouldn't have been the focus like I always made them.  Seeing the families and how close they were made realize how lucky I really was as a dad and hey, I had the extra time and effort to do the same.  I'd always been self-serving and self-centered but I was just playing the part of the leader of the family. I guess I really didn't understand what that meant to all the others around me until one of my best friends told me that his daughter was suffering from an advanced form of cancer. He spent every waking moment with her hand put everything else on his life on hold.  It was at that time I realized that if that ever happened to me, I'm not mentally equipped and I would have to find that type of determination in my soul which I currently don't have.  It was at that time I felt that I was no longer just the most important person in the world.  Being a father is much more than just being a someone who supports the family with material needs.   I would have to fundamentally change everything about me. I knew there was a reason I was looking forward to this day.

We quickly got ourselves ready at home and hurriedly packed ourselves into our small commuter sedan to start our day. On the way to the mall I asked my daughter, ""what is it like being 7? I'm sure it beats being 6 still!"". Blushing, she responded,"" I'm one step closer to being as old as you mommy! I wanna be just like you one day"". Her response melted my heart, I knew she always looked up to me for guidance and strength during times she wasn't feeling strong spirited, but it was even more meaningful to actually hear her say it out loud. As a single mother of 5 years, I always wanted to be strong for my little girl, and after her dad walked out on us, I knew she needed a strong role model in her life. Therefore, I made it my life's goal to do just that. Once we stopped at the mall in the next town over I started feeling this chest pain again that I experienced for the past two days. It wasn't something I was overly concerned about at the time, but it certainly did cause me enough pain to end the conversation I was having with my daughter. I didn't want to show her that I was in pain because mom's aren't supposed to get sick. Continuing to ignore the pain, we entered the mall ready to have a great day together when all of a sudden, the intensity of the pain grew even more. The pain was so bad that i dropped to my knees to the floor and yelled for someone to call an ambulance. it felt like my ribcage was about to cave in on itself.

My husband rushed me to our local hospital, although I had planned to delivery at a larger hospital in a nearby city. Our local hospital isn't very well-equipped, and there are no gyns on staff, and sometimes, there isn't even a doctor there. But I had no choice, It was close, and I was suffering, so we went. Fortunately, a doctor was available, though she wasn't an ob-gyn. The baby was coming so fast, there was no time for an epidural, so I couldn't have any pain meds. Also fortunately, my baby, Charles, was healthy and continues to do well a week later. I wish I could say the same for myself. The pain usually goes away after delivery, but that didn't happen. I had and still have very bad low back pain. Sometimes it is excruciating, so bad, in fact, that I find it difficult to stand.

So I went to the landlord to tell him that my pipes in my bathroom were leaking and he needed to get a plumber here to take a look at them.

He gave me an evil eye as soon as he saw me, he spoke to me rudely and asked what I wanted and why was I bothering him. First of all, I am not bothering anyone, this is his job and that is what he needs to do. I was polite though, I am not going to be rude about it, anyway. I told him that my pipes were leaking and I needed someone to come look at it. He asked me if I had looked at it myself because if I could do it myself then I should be here asking him.

That was the wrong thing to say to him, because he jumped up out of his chair, yelled at me called me an idiot and stupid and that he should rip uo my contract to the apartment because he was tired of me being needy.

Well, he was there waiting for me in the entry way with a completely different look on his face.

I had a really serious damage and, according to the contract, he had to pay compensation to me and get the roof repaired. he would have to pay a substantial amount for these expenses. he told me that, despite the contract between us, he would not pay anything, that if I wanted to sit, I had to accept the building like this, that the rent rate would increase very much due to the shopping mall to be opened soon, and that I was so stupid that I could almost know that I was sitting for free. the landlords in this neighborhood kept saying how positive the new shopping mall would be. but things did not go as expected by the landlords.

We sat and chatted over coffee during my break and caught up on each other's lives. He told me about his family and how great he and his wife were doing. While chatting about what a nightmare our previous employer was and gossiping about former coworkers, they told me that they too finally left the place. They were frustrated that the career wasn't going anywhere and have been working odd end and meager jobs while applying for more suitable positions. He was also growing concerned because he has a family to support and his wife is already working as much as she can. I told him about my current company and the culture there and expressed that we are usually looking for people. I asked him if he could email me his resume and information and I would try to forward it on to my boss. We exchanged information and I went back to work. As soon as I checked my email, my old colleague's resume was there. As promised, I went to my boss and told her about him and his situation. She listened and said the we should be able to find something for him so I thought so highly of him. I gave her the resume and his information and left. I returned to my cubicle and sent him a quick note to let him know that his information was passed on and my boss sounded interested in him. I asked him to keep in touch and let me know how things went. I also asked if he wanted to get together sometime soon after the job search stress was over.

When I look into my mirror, I don’t just see a failing pancreas and two kidneys that have been laid off. I don’t just see a very sickly person who might die. I see a woman and a mother whose life and personality have many different dimensions. A woman with a family that needs her more than ever. It wasn’t always that way. In the beginning, when I was going through hemodialysis and had more than 15 graft surgeries and 17 tunneled catheter procedures, I felt like my illness was stamped across my forehead and imprinted on my heart. End-stage renal disease and hemodialysis seemed to have taken over my whole life. I was a patient. I barely remembered who I was before the disease. Eventually, I’d finally had enough of being defined by my disease. I needed to take charge of my life. The first time I spoke up about what I wanted in regard to my treatment, my doctors were stunned. I took control and it was the best choice I had ever made--I think it may have saved my life. For the first time since I began dialysis, my doctors saw me as a whole person--a mother, an individual--and not just as a patient. Even more importantly, I was seeing myself as more than just my disease. Gaining my voice gave me back the parts of my life that I had missed. I was Cortney again, not just the lady with ESRD on dialysis.  My disease no longer consumed my whole life.",Was a dialysis a right choice to make for my mom? Doctor was forcing us to it.

I drove us over to Disney World, and we set out on our adventure.  First we went on Space Mountain - I think Billy screamed more than I did.  We went on Big Thunder Railroad, and laughed like kids the entire time.  We went over to Epcot for a food tour - we both liked the Japananese food, and the beers in the Germany area.  We reminisced about the old times growing up, and our parents.  Billy shared with me that he still wasn't ready to settle down, but did have a girlfriend in London who sounded lovely.

3AAJC4I4FHEJMZ2HTFMNPVH85MGZJO,"It's been almost two months since I've opened my journal here. What a roller coaster these intervening weeks have been. For the last 3 months I've had intermittant swelling and pain in my leg. Joe finally convinced me to see the doctor, after my usual fuss about useless tests. Well, turns out (after several rounds of all those ""useless"" tests), they found a blood clot! So the good news and the bad news. They can't operate (well, I guess that is both good and bad, since surgery is not on my bucket list!.) They can treat it with medicine (ugh, but I should be, and kind of am, grateful for that.) But the real killer (bad choice of words!) is that I have had to make some dramatic changes in my life style. That's good and bad too I suppose. I needed to make some changes anyway, as I know since retiring I have been way too sedentary. But the tricky part is: I need to walk daily, but not too much. And, I can sit and stand, but not for long periods of time. (Guess I will scratch off my bucket list flying to Australia...or any flights longer than 2 hours.) On the one hand, I am so grateful that this is treatable, and honestly, probably NOT what I will end up dying from. On the other hand, it is one more thing that I have to think about... a lot. Seeing that my besetting sin is worrying and anxiety, this does NOT help. But, I do see that this trauma (okay, maybe that is a bit dramatic) no longer shakes my faith like such things used to. That sign of spiritual growth is encouraging. Joe and other family members have been really supportive, as has our church and our friends. And, as is always the case, I'm praying and reading Scripture more. And, walking more and going to the gym. The most annoying thing is that I've had to set my alarm to make sure I don't sit for more than 1/2 an hour at a time...and of course, I have to remember to set my alarm! And each day slips by so quickly that sometimes I forget (Joe calls it motivated forgetfulness...ha) to go take my twice daily walks.

I always love to observe art on the streets or in museums but 3 weeks ago I got to have a very cool art experience. Many neighbors came together to paint a mural in the middle of the intersection. It was my first time to pain on a street and the first time to paint a ten foot manatee. We chose the manatee because it is the elementary school's mascot. It was also a great way to get the kids involved. I learned about how to paint on the street and make sure it isn't easily washed out. This was a really great experience for me because I paint often. I am no master artist or anything but I think this experience has given me a huge burst of inspiration. I do not think I will start creating graffiti or anything but I might start using different tools. My choice paint is watercolor because of how delicate it is and soft and beautiful the strokes come out. It takes patience because what appears when you paint, and what comes out when it dries are two different images. What I love about painting the street is that it is easy to just make corrections immediately without having to wait much. This was a great experience that opened my eyes to new things.

Religion has had such an effect on me, powerful and loving, that I want to spread the message to others. A couple of months ago I decided that I might even be comfortable enough with the teachings that maybe I could teach a class. I decide the best step for me would be to teach to adults, not to children. So, I signed up to teach a class this fall. Last week, I was preparing for the first lesson. I wanted to be extra prepared for next week, which is the first class, so I started early. Well wouldn't you know, I encountered a passage that really touched me deep down. I had read it before, but it didn't affect me the way it did a week ago. It was really touching, and really moved me. It said that I must adorn myself with righteousness. Righteousness, what's that supposed to mean, and why does it matter? Well, to be righteous tells us that we have to do the right thing ... to have good behavior. It does not mean that you have to be perfect. I caught myself crying, because for my journey so far, I have been so fixated on speaking the word of the Lord exactly as he said it. I was worried that if it wasn't exactly right, my students wouldn't buy into the story. But I was wrong... It's not about being perfect and just like the Lord. Only He can do that. It's about doing my best to teach others so that they can receive His love too, by following his teachings.","I studied to teach the Bible to adults.

3TGOYF991Y8BEGJ1ZRRTF5B4JV4UUG,When I was growing up I could not stand dealing with this person. We really didn't get a long very well in school to the point that we had become rivals even though we were of opposite genders. We would go out of our ways to mess with each other and just do things to make the others life more difficult while we were going to school together. As we got older and popularity in high school mattered we would do things to mess with the other in that regard to. I felt like this rivalry between us would never end because he would always end up getting the better of me when it came to our little wars of words going back and forth. When I graduated from high school I figured that this rivalry would likely end because of everyone going their separate ways and low and behold this one did not. He was still in my life as we had some mutual friends and he would be at some of the same places that I was heading to. I felt like at this point it was best to really try to bury the hatchet with this guy. We had been feuding with each other since we were in elementary school so I really felt like it was time to just try to settle this and move on to something else to let us both go on with your lives like we are true adults. When I first attempted to do this he just kinda laughed and acted like there was no way this had any chance of ever happening. So I decided that this just wasn't going to happen at this point in time and just let it go. After that I didn't see him for a little while and wondered what had happened. I almost felt concerned because even though how we felt about each other I had known him for a long time and didn't want anything bad to happen. I finally saw him again about 4 months ago and I asked him where he had been. He explained that he had a few bad things come up in life that he had to take care of so he didn't really have time to go to parties and just hang out anymore. I felt like he was in a bad place so I asked him to dinner with me and he said ok. When we could just sit down and talk together we really hit it off with one another right away. I feel like this was truly a day that changed my life as today we are together and looking to get married. When we really got to know each other we realized that we were a perfect match and maybe the reason we didn't get a long all those years ago was because we were just to much alike so it caused friction between us. I am truly grateful that we got to sit down and realize that we we're meant to be together.,Long time enemy become my life partner in single party. That is the short of this story.

That day i had taken off of work early so that i could be there in time for the ceremony. As i was leaving the office and getting into my car i was excited at the prospect of seeing him walk the stage after working for four years in high school to get his diploma and looked forward to celebrating with everyone afterwards. I was taking the usual route to get to his school, though it was earlier than i was used to going but i knew the route well, when i saw a car stalled on the side of the road. At first i didnt think much of it as breakdowns and car problems werent uncommon to see on the road but then i noticed flickering light from inside the car. I moved lanes to get closer as i approached to see if there was a problem and as i moved closer i could tell that the light was caused by a fire in the car and couldn't see anyone around who looked as though they had gotten out of the car. I then immediately pulled over to see if anyone was still inside and started calling 911 in case anyone needed help or at the very least to report a potential fire hazard. By the time i had gotten out of my car i had already gotten a hold of the emergency operator and began explaining the situation. The operator told me to be careful but asked if i could see anyone in the car. I looked through the windows to see if i could see someone and though the smoke had now begun to make things difficult to see i could barely make out a driver. I immediately reported this to the operator and opened the door to get to the driver and as i did smoked sprung forth from the now open door. Luckily the fire appeared to have not spread to the front and i was able to get the driver out relatively easily and though they were unconscious they were breathing so i moved them away from the car and waited for the ambulance to arrive. By the time they arrived the car had fully caught on fire and they began immediately checking the driver and asking me questions. It took me quite a while before i was finally able to leave but despite this excitement i couldn't really do anything else to help and my sons graduation had already started so i left hoping i could still make it in time to see him cross the stage.

I have been volunteering for the past five years. In the past, the animals played on a playground at the animal shelter that was covered with gravel. Although the animals had a good time playing in the secure playground, they often experienced discomfort when playing at the playground. Gravel would become lodged in the pets paws and often would create problems such as tender, sore paws. Also, gravel would be tracked indoors and created the need to do extra cleaning and facility maintenance. Even though the gravel posed some problems, the animals loved the playground just the same.

When I heard about the plans to install green turf at the playground, I was beyond excited as I looked forward to saying goodbye to gravel.

After the turf was installed, the time came to let the animals out to explore their new playground. The excitement that the animals showed when they rolled around on soft turf was heartwarming.

I have been going to counseling to help with my guilt and all the negative emotions overcoming a drug addiction.

Thankfully I was never arrested over it and dont have any real permanent consequences, except for my anxiety and depression right now. I am on medicine for that to help regulate my emotions again.

Anyways, the drive there was pretty uneventful except for a huge accident on the interstate that caused us to arrive about a half hour later than we had anticipated. When we entered the casino, and that unforgettable scent of stale cigarette smoke and spilled booze hit me in the nose, those siren sounds of the slot machines caressed my eardrums, and the highly oxygenated air filled my lungs, I felt like today was going to be my day. Something was different about this trip, an electricity was in the air, and it was not the same electricy I had felt on so many of mmy prior trips to this particular casino. I handed my girlfriend a hundred dollar bill and she made a beeline for the high-limit slots, while I directed myself to the craps table. Let me tell you it was hopping, and everybody was cheering and hollering, but most importantly making some serious dough. I see a spot open up, so I belly up to the table and place a pass line bet, and wait for the shooter to throw. The shooter, a black gentleman who looks like he's knows a little about throwing dice, grabs the shiny red cubes and tosses them a couple of times against the sidewall, then arranges them meticulously before snatching them up and tossing them high into the air. They land at the other side of the table, bounce once and careen off the backwall, then land softly; the stickman has a look. ""Seven, front line winner, pay the line!"", he calls out. The stickman slides the dice back to the shooter, where he again arranges and then tosses them expertly. ""Yoooooo eleven! Pay the line!"" calls the dealer as the players pick thier winnings up off the table. Well wouldn't you believe it, this shooter would go on to hit five straight points, earning me a cool thousand dollars in the process! I was so happy, I decided to treat my girlfriend to eat at the casino buffett afterwards, where we dined on delicious crab legs the size of a baby's arm, and prime rib so succulent, it melted the moment it hit your tounge.

3Y4W8Q93L06PATXFIMB91R900YRVDO,"Around four months ago I took a huge leap of faith and finally got some help for my anxiety and depression. I was scared, nervous, and not really sure what to expect. The doctor who helped me was fantastic, she helped figure out my triggers, what exactly it was that was making me so anxious and prescribed me a new medicine to help me calm down. I had been taking it for about a week or so when I started noticing some changes in my body. I was losing weight, and fast. I expected some differences in behavior the first few weeks due to the chemical changes happening but I was not expecting weight loss. I chalked it up to the medication and figured it was a minor side effect and continued taking my medicine as prescribed. After about three weeks of taking this medicine I looked like a normal girl. All of my clothes were falling off my body, I had to go buy new clothing. I felt fantastic; 50 pounds down in 3 weeks! When I went into the doctors office again, my doctor was shocked and had a look of horror on her face. I told her that I loved how I had looked and that it is the best medication because I felt so much better. The doctor immediately told me that this was not what was supposed to happen with my medicine. She immediately told me that I would no longer be getting that prescription, that losing that much weight in such a short time span was incredibly unhealthy and she would like to run blood work to make sure I was okay. Luckily the blood work came back just fine. I was a lucky patient. After going home, new medication in hand, I looked at myself in the mirror. I am the girl I used to be. I am no longer the ""fat"" friend. I realized that my anxiety and depression was caused by my lack of self confidence. I made a goal that day to work out and keep this weight off. It has been 3 months now since the weight gain and I have reduced doses of my medication. I am doing fantastic without them! It took a major change to see that it wasn't all chemical but also self confidence issues that was causing all of my anxiety.

3LPW2N6LKUOUT1TMYQJL7TJOKEBU5Y,"Last week i was working my usual night time shift with the usual crew. We were doing some construction on a particularly busy road, so everything had to be done at night when we would not be disrupting traffic flow too much. It was a pretty involved job since we had to dig up the road to extend the sewers so that it would connect to the new apartment complex the city wanted built. It was job to stand at one end of the work area holding a sign to alert anyone coming towards us that the road was closed. Typically, this was a pretty boring job, and most people knew what was going on so they avoided the area anyways. This night however, was different. It was around 2am when I started hearing some really loud, drunken laughing coming from down the road. After a little bit, I saw a group of 6 rather large men stumbling down the road, walking towards me. The group definitely noticed me, because I saw one of them point right at me as they got closer, their laughter kind of quieting down and being replaced by some angry shouting. Our work site was completely blocking their path and they didn't seem too happy about it. As they got closer, I got nervous. I quietly signaled to some more of the crew to come over and back me up in case things got messy. As they got closer, I began to fear for the worst. It is not easy to reason with drunks, and these guys were big guys. They could easily beat me up if they wanted to. For whatever reason, once they were about 15 feet away, they stopped in their tracks, kind of stood there for a bit looking puzzled. We locked eyes. After a short delay, they turned right around, and walked down an adjacent street.

And I would have thought that after all that time together they would have already discussed what they want for a wedding and definitely how they each feel about kids, but apparently not! Just 5 weeks ago my friend's fiance told him that she wants an extravagant wedding, which he just doesn't have the money for or interest in. When he told her that the money could be better saved to spend on a home for them and their kids. She almost knocked him over when she said she didn't want any kids or a house for that matter. I mean it is her right to say no to kids and his right to say no to the expensive wedding but I really can't believe that the 2 of them have never discussed this in 7 years. Now our friends are divided among them in a fight over him saying no to the expensive wedding and her saying no to the kids. I am staying out of it and keep telling them both that they each have the right to say no to those things they don't want.

After getting ready I took my bike and went outside. I had to go for some errands. On the way, I heard a strange sound. I was shocked when I saw some people standing near by the local gas station. I innocently went there to see the actual situation. I got surprised when I saw a person standing there and making arguments with the people around him and suddenly he maced several people. The situation got me out of my control and I called the police. The cops came and took the situation under their control and went with the person.  The man's behavior surprised me a lot.

I was grateful that no one paid much attention to me. The gas station snacks were strewn all over the floor. I put some Snickers bars in my pocket.  Feeling guilty for some reason, I started helping the store personnel to clean up. I was thinking about the cameras and how I might get busted once the cops review the macing footage.  This made me excited. No one seemed to care about a few snacks. They mostly bitched and whined about the crazy psycho that went on the macing rampage all of a sudden. After the cops came, I quickly bolted and wondered how it would have felt to mace other people. Hmm, maybe I should start seeking my shrink again....

I feel pretty good about the fact that I was able to get back on the wagon, but I'm also pretty disappointed in the fact that I fell off to begin with. I'd say that's 8 years wasted, down the drain, but my support group says that I need to consider that addiction is an illness that never actually subsides. It will always be there with you, so it's important to be weary of triggers for relapse, but I was still an addict for those 8 years so it's not that I've failed. As you know, a year ago, my mother passed away. After she passed, her house was seized by the bank and that's where I had been living while I try to get my life in order. Karen came to the funeral and when I told her about my issues, she said she had just the thing to pick me up. I shouldn't have been hanging out with her to begin with, but with the passing of my mom, it seemed like she just wanted to reminisce about the good old days and I was really feeling the nostalgia. So, I went to the party with her and in my desperation, started drinking while we were there. It was a wild night, and I really wasn't in a good head space. I ended up passing out on the uber ride home and she had to practically carry me to my bathroom. We tipped the uber pretty well. I woke up on the bathroom floor and immediately regretted my night, but thought.. 'to hell with it' and went to the liquor store right away and stocked up. I drank for about 3 days straight thinking I'd be able to get back on the wagon myself, but those few days of acceptance led to months of acceptance and I found myself at work trying to hide my vodka in a water bottle. When my brother came to visit, he noticed all of the empty bottle in the trash and convinced me to take a week off and go to a rehab facility. I agreed and my time there was nice, they really helped me understand my triggers and forgive myself while taking responsibility for my actions. Since my release, I've been going to AA meetings and tonight I got my 60 day chip. I'm confident in my progress but I am still a little ashamed of the fact that I fell so far off the wagon after 8 years.

I thought I'd had experiences with losing sleep before, but nothing has ever compared to this. Even being healthy, early birth aside, I couldn't help but feel something could and would go wrong at any moment. I was constantly on edge, thinking some nurse would come in to tell me he'd taken a turn for the worse. All of this and overall environment made it impossible to get anything resembling a solid night's sleep. I'm sure I got some, since I wouldn't be alive right now to write this if I hadn't. But, it felt like I may as well have awake the whole three weeks. I also got very accustomed to the taste of hospital food and the beeping of machines. That could maybe be considered a life skill in future situations I hope I'm never in again. I was lucky to have my family around for support, at least. Although I'm sure I acted more than a little nuts to them, they managed to put up with me regardless. I don't know if I've ever had a moment of pure relief more powerful when the doctors told me he was ready to come home, and was doing fine.

I went to bed late last night since I could not get my mine off the big day tomorrow. I woke up in the morning feeling a bit tired, and at the same time I was a bit nervous.

After sitting there for about 15 minutes, the supervisor came back to the break room and asked if I had received an email couple days before. She then told me that I was actually rescheduled to start tomorrow instead of today. I was quite disappointed and awkward that I actually went to work on the wrong day.

3HHRAGRYX9RIHJB15UKTK3W2DAN9O7,"It's been two months since I saw the doctor for my problem.  Without warning, there were times I was hit with the sudden urge to pee and ended up holding it too long.  I knew that I probably had an infection, and I did.  I remember while I was waiting in the office thing that with my luck, it was quite possible that I would just wet my pants right there and then.  Holding my pee had become a regular habit for me.  It all started six months prior when I saw a family friend that I hadn't seen in awhile.  As soon as I saw him, my heart started pounding.  My stomach dropped to the floor and, of course, I had to pee right away.  All of the bad memories assaulted my mind in a matter of seconds.  The way he had sexually assaulted me those many years ago.  All of a sudden, it seemed like it had happened just seconds before.  So that was the day that holding my pee became a problem.  I wet myself and left in quite a hurry.  It was positively humiliating to me but I'm pretty sure no one else noticed because I left so quickly.  So now, it's a common problem.  I never know when it's going to hit me, but as soon as the flashbacks happen, the urge to pee always follows and I feel frozen in place trying to hold my pee.  I thought maybe it would stop after a few times but it seems to be going strong 6 months later and I'm at my wits end as to what to do.  The doctor had treated my infection but I suspected that I needed a therapist at this point.

It was such a great time and I loved every moment of it. We plan on going back the next chance that we get. One of the biggest things that I remember the most was going on a hiking trail with my husband and stopping to sit at the top of the hill. When we were hiking the trail it was really dreary and pale out but the moment we got to the top it was clear and sunny. It was such an amazing view of the entire town that I was so happy. It was so breath taking and such a nice family moment that we got to share together. After the hike we went straight to a local pub that was recommended and had some of the best local beers I've had in a long time. Overall the entire trip was amazing.

I asked her out to dinner and she said no, that her main and primary focus was on church. I then asked her about god, if she believed in everything the bible said and if maybe she would like to go out with me on a date to bible study and she actually said yes to both questions. A week later we met up at bible study and  after the lesson we had the type to sit and talk to each other about life, love and god. She told me that god is her first love and that she will always believe in and put God above everyone else in her life. I told her that was sweet and that I actually do the same, once she saw that I actually had the same beliefs as her she wanted to get to know more of me. It was sweet and romantic and we continued to meet up at church and bible study and we learned a lot about each other while also learning about each other. We would discuss God, the bible and our beliefs. We would talk about how the earth came to be, how we came to be and  the things that made us and the people around us similar. We both decided to join the church choir together and it was the best decision I have ever made in my life. Not only did it make her very happy but it made our relationship so much stronger, singing, learning and loving god together has truly been a blessing in my entire life. I never would have thought I would form such an amazing bond with someone and share the same views so much with someone like I do with her. I feel like she is my soulmate and our entire  relationship revolves around our religion and our love for christianity and the bible and I think that this is a beautiful thing.

30JNVC0ORA6EH160IJ0PMPPQBOMHQM,"I grew up in the bible-belt in a rural town in America.  I was raised by my mother and her parents.  They were devout Southern Baptists, and I was raised to be the same.  As I got older my views about the origins of the world and humanity changed quite a bit.  I grew to believe in the things I was being taught in my science and history classes rather than the religious stories that my family repeated over and over.  None of this changed my love for my family and I never felt the need to let them know that my views about religion had changed.  Not only would they be hurt, they would be down right frightened for my everlasting soul.  It would be a real big deal, and since it doesn't harm me in any way to pretend that I still agree with their religious beliefs, I just let it go.  They're not going to change their minds, and I'm not going to change mine.  This is a situation where ignorance really is bliss for all parties involved.  I even still go to church with my family when I'm home.  I enjoy catching up with people I've known since childhood.  The social gathering remind me of growing up, and even if I don't believe I can still enjoy a great church potluck. So six months ago I was home for a couple of weeks and I went to one of those lunches with my family and I was introduced to Sue.  Sue and I hit it off in a big way.  We spoke for hours that day and ended up having coffee and then dinner together before I left town.  We text each other daily and talk on the phone often, and I've made a couple of trips back home just to spend more time with her.  That chance meeting has evolved into a relationship, but, even though Sue and I have similar backgrounds, we don't share the same beliefs.  Unlike me, Sue does believe in God and she's every bit as involved with her religion as my family is.  I haven't told Sue that I don't share her Christian beliefs.  I think that's going to be a deal breaker for her and I'm just not sure what to do at this point.

My fiance and I went to her parents house to stay there and take care of their dogs because they happened to be out of town at the time.  We camped out in the living room because we didn't want to stay in their room, it just felt weird.  One of the nights the power went out, and I remember one of their dogs walking on my face trying to get in close; she doesn't like storms, or power outages apparently.  I went out onto their back porch during the storm at one point.  The wind was really strong, and cold, but it was kind of fun standing out there.  The dogs didn't like it for sure; they wouldn't even come close to going outside to pee.  The next day the backyard was full of branches and leaves that had fallen because of the wind.  There was even a big branch in the pool, which I had to go in and get out so it wouldn't scratch the liner on the bottom of the pool.  It was ridiculously cold.  Luckily that was the worst of the problems.  We took a walk with the dogs the next day around the neighborhood.  There was a lot more damage to other houses than we got, which was lucky.

Around the 5th grade I started playing the guitar and I have never stopped. My all time favorite thing to do is sit alone in my house and play along to my favorite artists. I was thrilled to find out that my granddaughter had picked up a similar passion. She saw my guitar hanging on the wall one day and asked to play with it. I took it down and showed her a few chords. After that she was hooked. She started taking lessons and now she is a very talented guitarist. Even though she is older now she still stops by a few times a month to play music with me. A few months ago I was listening to the radio and I heard them advertise a concert ticket giveaway. The tickets were for one of my favorite musicians, a very talented singer and guitar player. I called into the station and somehow managed to win the tickets. I had never won anything before, and I never expected to be able to see this musician live so I was thrilled.

3M81GAB8A154QO3EIRQT0EMRRRYQB1,"Six months ago, my wife had a terrible reaction to her chemotherapy treatment.  She was fine at the treatment center, but once we got home she became violently ill.  She retched for hours and hours.  I felt helpless.  All of the information that they gave us did not prepare us for this.  She was shaking and feverish and could not stop throwing up, even when there was nothing left to expel.  When helped her into bed I noticed that her was seemed higher, she was awfully pale, and her breathing became shallow and labored.  When I tried to wake her, she didn't respond.  That is when I called the ambulance. As the ambulance was wheeling my beloved wife out of the house, my dog started howling.  He must have known something was wrong and was reacting to the palpable emotions around him.  I put him on his leash so that he wouldn't run out the door, and I led him outside.  He continued to howl, even with my comforting pats.  As I approached the ambulance behind my wife, a paramedic told me that my dog couldn't come in the ambulance.  It was then that my new neighbor stepped over to us.  I hadn't met her yet, but I had seen her taking out the trash and playing with her kids on the front lawn, and she was always friendly.  She bent down and began soothing my dog and told me not to worry about the pup.  She would watch him for as long as we needed.  She told me to focus on my wife.  The dog would be fine.  Her children who were several feet behind her also volunteered to help.  I almost cried in relief and gratitude.  I couldn't believe my new neighbor was so kind and selfless.  I thanked her and handed her the leash.  She looked at me with sympathy and told me not to worry about a thing.","My wife reacted to chemotherapy treatment in a very negative way.

I didn't know her very well at all, just enough to see her and waive from across the street, but outside of initial greetings when we moved into the neighborhood earlier in the year, I had almost no interaction with her. But we were desperate, my wife's been sick but doing okay until her negative reaction to that chemotherapy. In that kind of bind, the offer to help with watching the dog since great. Sadie's a very friendly golden lab, I figured she wouldn't be much trouble for our neighbor Leslie to take care of and I'd give her some money to get the dog food while we were at the hospital. Well, it took a turn I wasn't expecting and I'm not sure what to do next. My wife is doing a bit better, but her time in the hospital has been tough on us both and she's not totally out of the woods. I go home almost every day, but I basically live at the hospital. And we still don't know many people in town who could help with the dog. But the neighbor is really becoming difficult and I'm afraid I need to get Sadie back from her right now and consider a new option. She's clearly taken to Sadie a bit too much and I think she might try to keep her once we get back. But this is our dog, we've had her since she was a puppy, she's a member of the family. We can't even imagine throwing away the last 10 years with her. She's like our daughter. But I can't just leave her with the neighbor any longer since I think the attachment she's formed is a bit too great. Last time I was home and I stopped over to see Sadie, Leslie had her dressed in a matching outfit to her. And there were pictures of the two of them up in the house. After speaking with another neighbor last week, I now realize that Leslie is widowed in the last two years and been on her own since. I think she might be lonely and Sadie has been great for her. But really, a bit too great. So I'm not sure what to do, but I'm certain leaving her there is no longer an option. I'm going to ask some people at the hospital if there are options for bringing her in with me or a kennel. Or maybe even a house sitter? I'm not sure about a house sitter because I'm not clear on how Leslie will respond to seeing someone else with Sadie. Quite a pickle we're in, but Sadie is part of the family and she's staying with us regardless, she can't become someone else's pet long term no matter how helpful it's been the last few months.","My wife reacted to chemotherapy treatment in a very negative way.

So for our second wedding anniversary, I planned a trip to go visit the historic home. We decided to drive out to the home in Missouri because it just didn't feel right to fly. We spent the first night in a small bed and breakfast just a few miles from the Wilder home. I don't think my wife slept more than a few hours she was so excited. The next morning we hit the road very early. She wanted to spend as much time as possible exploring the home so we didn't waste any daylight. The home was everything we'd imagined and more. It felt like we were transplanted back to the late nineteenth century. There were reenactors dressed up like the Wilder family. They had all the old tools and machinery commonly seen around settler homes back then. They were doing ordinary daily chores like scrubbing clothes. We even got to see a settler churning real butter from cream. Then there were the animals. I think this was my favorite part. Seeing how the cows and other animals were kept and maintained was kind of a thrill to me. By the end of the day we were both exhausted.

I guess I looked pretty foolish, like a tourist, because a native Philippine approached me and asked if I needed any help. I can't even tell you how glad I was that someone actually decided to come over to help me out. I'm really shy, so I have problems talking to strangers on my own. I explained to her my situation and she gladly decided to help me out. I told her the name of my hotel and she instantly new where to go. The ride on her bike was some of the most fun memories I ever had in my life. She pointed out a lot of the history and culture of her city on our way to my hotel, our conversation was entertaining.

We had so much in common, and there was just an instant chemistry and connection. We clicked. It was like a match had been ignited, and thus grew the flame of our love. I had found someone who valued the same things I did, and felt the same deep compassion I felt for animals. Being an animal advocate is an important part of who I am, and finding someone who felt animal advocacy was a core part of their being excited me.

I still remember the time when it dawned on me, all that she had done to me. I remember it all sinking in. I was disappointed. It was hurtful. I genuinely cared for her and it was obvious to me that it wasn't really reciprocal. She was selfish for a very long time. I didn't think cutting her out of my life would lead to her demise.

3SLE99ER0OZD4G455N96R7YWMZUBZT,"One of the hardest decisions I had to make was when I resigned from my job as a teacher. 6 months ago my husband's company decided to transfer him to a different state, and I was no longer going to be able to commute to this job. We wanted to keep our family together, so we all moved together, my husband, me, and our two children who are also in elementary school. I decided that for awhile I will be a stay at home mom and take care of our two boys while they are in their younger years. I think my teaching background will help with this and make it a good experience for them. I was very sad to leave my job because I love my coworkers and students. My students have always been great, and they gave me little cards that they made to wish me good luck in the future and told me that they will miss me. At the same time, I think there will be an opportunity for me in the future to become principal of a local school in our new area. I had thought about moving up like this for awhile and might have the opportunity a few years down the road. I have enrolled in a graduate program to prepare me for this next step in my journey and will be able to dedicate more time to it since I will be staying at home with the kids and will have some time during the day while they are at school. It was difficult for me to leave everything I knew and the city I grew up in to move away with my husband, but I think it will also open new doors and new opportunities for me. I have needed a little push to get me going in the direction I want to be going, and this might help me take the leap and go the next step in my career. My husband is very happy about his promotion and transfer, and I think this will end up being a promotion for me as well. My students and I all took a picture on my last day and I have it framed in our new house. It was hard and tear-filled when I had to say goodbye to my colleagues and leave the building with a box of my stuff. Most surprising to me has been that several of my students parents have reached out to me on social media, so I think that will be a nice way to keep in touch with my roots and not completely lose touch with my home town. I have become friends with one parent in particular who I always viewed as a difficult parent, but she is very well-meaning and wants the best for her children and I have a completely different view of her now that we are friends and not just seeing each other in parent-teacher meetings. It is interesting to see different sides of people and see things you didn't think you would see. The other thing that was difficult for me was that our new town is smaller than our old one and it seems a little bit more difficult to meet people but I am hoping that being in school will help with that, and I might try to start some social groups, which is something I had always thought about doing. Overall I feel like a new life is blossoming in front of me.","This is a short story about the time I resigned my job as teacher. It was difficult and sad, but students supported me.",120.0

Not too mention going to a climate that is much dryer and much more hotter and or coldrer depending on the time of day that where we live. I found myself feeling ill and just wanting to rest the whole time. Unfortunately with so many people in one big house there was no time for that. We managed to have an enjoyable time. We cooked together, watched movies together. The kids got off of their devices for a short time and actually played board games. I purchased my mom a champagne cake made by an award winning bakery (very expensive) because her birthday was in mid November. We were all very happy, and were appreciative that my mom is still with us.

The house needed new aluminum siding, and the lawn looked sad and dead. My heart sank. I then realized that I got catfished.

I saw a neighbor and went over to talk to her, when I saw out of the corner of my eye my son's truck rolling into the water. Too late, I saw my son fall in after it. Between me, my neighbor, and a few passerby, we were able to get him out quickly, but it was a stressful experience for both of us.  Luckily, he calmed down and seemed to forget the incident within the hour. Me on the other hand, I'm still reliving it everyday. It's amazing that it happened to my son, and he's fine, while I'm still in shock about it!

I have probably bought him 5 kites over the past few months and he spends hours playing with them. He called me one day 2 weeks ago to tell me his parents bought him the biggest kite he ever had and he wanted to come to my house to fly it in the yard. I said of course he could come over, so I made plans with his parents and they were on their way. While they were on the way, I ordered a few pizzas and went to the corner store to get some candy and soda. 30 minutes later, I saw them in the driveway. He jumped out of the car with a kite twice the size of him and told me to go to the back yard. We both ran to the back and started getting ready. The wind was perfect for flying kites. I offered to help him get it right and ready, but he assured me he could do it. He actually did it himself. 20 minutes later, he was running up and down the lawn, laughing and staring up at the sky.

I know it seems silly to celebrate every month but we are all still so happy she is here and healthy. I remember 4 months ago like it was yesterday. I was in Bali enjoying a vacation with my friends when I got a call from my son in law. My daughter had gone into labor very unexpectedly. She was only 28 weeks pregnant and something had caused her to go into pre-term labor. I don't remember how I did it but I managed to get to the airport and on a plane within a few hours. The flight was long and I had no cell phone service the entire way, I have never been so scared in my entire life. Once I landed and turned my cell phone on I had probably 30 text messages and missed calls, the baby had been born. She was healthy! I don't think I'd ever felt such relief in my entire life.

3RJSC4XJ11GEDFH60J51IMVH3R4506,"It took a lot of effort on my part in order to acclimate my puppy to her new environment.  It wasn't so easy for her to feel comfortable the first few nights.  When she stayed with my sister, she had always slept in the bathroom off of her room.  My room didn't have a bathroom off of it.  Also, my sister has hardwood floors in her bedroom.  I have carpeted.  My thought it that my puppy liked the feel of the cold hardwood floors at night.  I'm under the impression that the carpet may have been slightly uncomfortable until my puppy got used to the temperature difference.  To test this theory, I bought a big piece of tile and put it at the foot of my bed.  Like the hardwood, the tile would stay cool overnight.  The very first night with the tile, it seemed like my puppy slept easier and didn't wake me up in the middle of the night.  My theory had been correct.  My puppy was to hot laying on the carpet because she already has long hair.  With the tile, it gave her a nice cool surface to relax on.  I'm not positive if this had anything to do with her eating and bathroom habbits though.  She ate very little and subsequently had to go the bathroom very little for the first week.  I'm not sure if she wasn't taking well to the environment change.  Potentially she had a specific routine of which she would go the bathroom at my sisters and had specific landmarks she associated with her location.  In order to combat this, I had my sister send over the kitty pool that she said my puppy loved to hop in and out of during the day.  I put this in the backyard to my house and in just two days, my puppy's mood seemed to elevate.  Not to mention, my puppy was getting much more exercise and was tuckered out from playing in the pool.  This instantly caused my puppy to eat and drink more.  All my problems seemed to be solved by simple observation and trial and error.","I brought my puppy home to live with after her staying with my sister since February.

She would occasionally brush it off and blame the fact that she was getting older as the cause. This went on for a few months. One morning when she woke up and got out of bed I noticed she was limping. I asked if she was okay and she explained that her leg was hurting worse than ever. I told her to call and make a doctors appointment and I would drive her up there to get it checked out. During her appointment, the doctor explained the issue and said she would need a minor procedure and the routine surgery to be performed would have her feeling better in no time. We met with the surgeon and he helped calm our any fears we had about about the procedure and did a fantastic job reassuring us that we should have nothing to worry about, it is a very common procedure. The day of the surgery they wisk my wife away for this routine procedure. They explained it would take about an hour and I would be able to see her after. A couple hours had passed and I began to worry if everything was alright. I asked a nurse for an update and she went and got a doctor who explained that there were some complications. They had cut an artery and bundle of nerves by accident, so things did not go as planned. I was horrified. The recovery process was much more entailed than expected. During this recovery she gained an infection from a small instrument they forgot inside her leg. They explained they would have to operate once more and they did so quickly. She almost lost her leg. The recovery process has taken much longer than anyone could have guessed. She now walks with a limp and has pain that is occasionally worse than it was before the surgery and this will continue the rest of her life.

I was having a great time socializing with the people at my table during breakfast and was looking forward to the awards being given to the winning teams and coaches. After giving a thunderous round of applause for each award recipient, everyone rose and gave a standing ovation.  The chairman of the Association approached the podium yet again. He began speaking about a new award being given this year. After much consideration, they decided to award the person who had worked above and beyond to increase the Association's membership.  As I sat in my chair, I felt so proud that such an important aspect of what makes our Association so successful would be honored today. I was so absorbed in this thought, that I initially paid no attention to my name being called. The person sitting next to me brought me back to the moment by nudging me with his elbow.

So I assume the idea was to make money on the increase in equity in The hot market back then. I bought it two years ago from the original owner, my dad knew him well. Apparently original owner was a mortgage broker and he and another guy bought 3 units. His main one is the one I bought. His partner(who I don’t see around much) still has a condo. I tried to sell it because I was moving to a new city, and there was many problems with the house. I bought it for 217 2 years ago.

I had just moved over from the Intake agent side of the call center, and was still only about six month into my tenure with the company.

I was packed, lunches and dinners were packed, so we were pretty much ready to go at this point. My wife went with me to keep me company when I wasn't on the mountain. There was just a couple of problems, we were going to get a few groceries before we left and the night prior, we were in a rush to get to work and forgot the list. Not to mention, I had forgotten to give my pager back before I left work. Not just any pager, but the pager that is reserved for medical emergencies at the hospital. So we made a trip back in (about a 1 hour drive, round trip) to return the pager and to get our groceries. By this time we were very tired, we had both worked a twelve hour shift prior to this and we were hoping to leave by around 3pm or 4 pm. This did not happen. We did not get home until about 1pm, so we were going to sleep until about 5 o'clock. Well we didn't get on our way until about 9pm. Arriving at the hotel at about 1am on Tuesday Morning, we were exhausted. Sleep came fairly quickly, knowing that I had to be up early the same morning to meet Brett at our hotel and and to take our beginner snow skills class. Climbing up the South Side of Mount HoodMeeting our guide and deciding whether or not to climb - Brett and I arrived early with plenty of time to meet Joe, our guide. Joe gave us an introduction of himself and his experience, checked our gear, asked us about our experience with climbing, had us sign the waivers that say if we die that they cannot be held liable. He then gave us the option, due to questionable weather to postpone the summit day for another time with better weather or to go ahead and try anyways the next day. After a short discussion, we decided to go ahead with it. After all we didn't want to have to make another long drive up to the mountain, and even if we didn't make the summit, we would still gain some experience, albeit expensive. Onward to the class we went. We learned how to kick steps, plunge step, self arrest techniques, traversing and the french step. We also learned several knots and proper roped travel. I must say I'm glad we drove up to Vermont last week. I saw beautiful foliage by a lake, in a field and from a gondola ride to the top of a mountain.","I drove up to Vermont last week.

I found this a little odd, since I'm a man and bridesmaids are usually women, but I decided to do it anyway to be a good friend. So, I went and got fitted for a dress like any other bridesmaid. The day of the wedding, I put on the dress and had my makeup done. I looked a lot like a drag queen, but if my friend wants a drag queen at her wedding, then that's what she'll get! The ceremony itself was very beautiful. People were a bit confused about why I was wearing a dress, but they adjusted after a bit and everything went smoothly. I now have a bridesmaid dress hanging in my closet. Not sure what I'll ever use that for again, though I might not need to get a Halloween costume this year. The experience of wearing the dress was not as bad as I thought. It was relatively comfortable. However, it was the high heels and bra that were the worst. These were very restrictive and somewhat painful. I have some blisters from the heels and the bra dug into my back. Also, I was a bit disappointed to find I was only an A cup.

They specifically wanted to go to Ireland, but we also decided to visit several other countries including Spain. I usually take my kids on one vacation every year, but I never would have dreamed of going to a place like Europe with them when they were younger. Now that they're a little older, I thought I would try to make it happen. We were really excited when we got on the plane two weeks ago, but the trip wasn't nearly long enough. We stayed for 10 days. The children have Irish ancestry from their father's side of the family, so they had a blast in Dublin. I wanted to go to Tenerife, Spain, and I think that the children had an even better time there.  Our favorite place we visited was a beach in Italy that sat on the Mediterranean. The children had never before seen a beach that had sea glass instead of sand. They spent hours just picking up sea glass and looking at it. The weather was absolutely perfect, but it was not warm enough to actually swim. We shared so many amazing memories with one another on the trip back home over the Atlantic.

Mind you, we were together for what - 4 years?  I was honestly expecting a ring this year for Christmas.  Needless to say from the start of my entry, that is not what happened at all.   In all our years, this was the first time he took me home with him for the holidays.  We usually went to my family events because his parents usually traveled to Peru for the holidays.  Since his grandmother had passed, they had no reason to go this year. and his mother made all kinds of elaborate plans that would span 5 days.  He must have asked me a thousand times if I wanted to go or not, or if I would be comfortable with all of his family speaking Spanish.  I am fluent - he knows this.  But, I thought he was just being considerate seeing that I am the only white person coming - the only person who does not have Hispanic roots, period. I assured him that I was fine, and I would be prepared for a bit of a cold shoulder coming at me.  I was tougher than I looked.  We arrived at his parents home on the 23rd of December.  The house was brightly decorated inside and out, and it smelled of cooking  - you know how it smells when there are several types of food layered on top of another - but it just smells like home?  Yes, like that.  Everyone was incredibly gracious and kind, and I made a good impression by helping with cooking, clean up, set up and just having general conversation with his family - even his allegedly racist great uncle. Oddly enough, Devan seemed angry that they were warming up to me so well, making snide comments like they liked me more than him, etc.  Often, I found myself alone with his family members while he was no where to be found, or off in a corner messing with his phone.   We left on the 28th, and had plans for a bug NYE party in the city - tickets I had paid $400 for.  He called me on NYE at 8pm (and hour AFTER he was suppose to meet me) and said that he had taken me to his family's home to see if he could get their approval before marrying me.  He SAID they were only being polite and that NO ONE actually liked me, and he was sorry, but he just couldn't be with someone that they did not approve of.  I must have cried for a week, but eventually I began to feel that he was lying because there was no way I could have misinterpreted the situation that badly for 5 whole days.  I called his mother to ask if I had left my Hermes scarf there (I knew I hadn't) and she talked my ear off for over an hour, and said how she couldn't wait until Easter so we could be together again, and that she had told Devan she couldn't wait to have a new daughter - that lying imp used his family as an excuse!","A game play made by my lover, acting like she doesn't loves me and breakup the relationship because of some problems at her home, that they oppose our love.",60.0

Among the other jobs that I had applied for I had suspicions that this one was not all that they said they would be. The site directed me to places that were allowing me to create an account with most of my important information attached. So,I decided to give it a chance to see if I could make any money.                               The next day,I received an email from them with a code in it. They said the code was to verify my information that I had submitted. I copied the code and went to the link that they supplied. I pasted the code in their submission box and a message suddenly popped up saying that my account had been suspended. They said that too many attempts had been made to confirm my information and for security seasons they were temporarily suspending my account. I was unable to login to my account so I sent them an email asking what they could do to assist me. They ignored my email and sent money to one of my accounts that they said they were going to use for verification and it was something that was merely attached to the payment method that I submitted for them to pay me.                      At that point they did not respond and I was left in the dark about how I was going to be able to get to my information.

We're just not happy with where we are currently.  We want to get out of the cold and enjoy a better environment.  I feel depressed here.  Unfortunately my family was upset about this.  They don't want us to leave.  I understand why, they love us, and they'll miss us.  But it's 2019, and there's plenty of ways that we can stay in touch.  We can still talk to each other on facebook and through text messages and stuff.

I was 21 years old then, after that my dad brung me, my two younger brothers and two sisters were still in school. I was just going into college and was misbehaving at a lot. I just didn’t care, had very poor performance and I got excluded a lot and when I was turning 23 I got kicked out of school for good; so then all I did was sit about the house all day ‘til my friends graduates. I started drinking and smoking hash nearly every day. I pushed drugs to earn a living. Then when I got a bit older, about 24/25, I started taking ecto’s (ecstacy) and coke, only really when I was drinking and mostly at the weekends. Then one day somebody asked me and my friend if we wanted to try smack! At first we were saying no, I hated that stuff, I had seen what it had done to people. Then we both decided we would try it, just once, and never again. So we took it. We had a good few hits each and it took all our worries, all the bad stuff that had happened in our pasts, away. So we started taking it every day. One day I woke up and felt really ill. My stomach was in so much pain, I had cramps and my legs were sore when I would be sitting. I was always fidgeting, I couldn’t stay still. My bones were aching, I thought I had the flu. My nose kept running and one minute I would be cold, 2 minutes later I’d be really hot. That’s when I realised I never had the flu, I was rattling. I had £10, so I went and got a bag of smack. I started smoking it, and straight away I felt normal again.

I thought it was a squirrel or skunk, so I paid it no mind. But then I saw this puppy come walking out right in front of us. I know the neighborhood well and have never seen anyone walking this puppy, so I assumed it was a stray. Later on, though, I saw signs up about it, so I called the people up to take it to them. Come to find out, they were using the poor thing for breeding. Puppies can be very expensive, so these people were making upwards of 400 bucks a pop off this almost adult dog. The weird thing is how open they were about it and how they didn't see anything wrong with it. They weren't licensed breeders, they don't know how to take care of dogs like this. I had to do something about it. I called up the humane society and a couple animal lovers to see if they knew what I should do. I was told it wasn't even illegal, which was a shock.

From the airport we took a taxi to our hotel, which was right in the middle of the city. Immediately, I knew that I was in a special place. The people in France were so much more open and kind to me than I had ever expected. As an American, there is a pervasive stereotype that the French are all mean and rude and nasty. This couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, the vast majority of Parisians that I interacted with were wonderful people. I found that as long as you are respectful towards them, they treat you with just as much respect back. Another thing I noticed about French people was that they are much more open to you if you try and speak a little French. I think that this shows them that you are trying to learn their culture, rather than forcing them to speak English. After our trip to France, we flew to Italy. My experience there was very similar to my experience in France. The people were wonderful and much more kind than I was expecting. On the whole, this experience changed my outlook on life.

I was super anxious, I didn't really know her at all. When I got to her home there was a lot of silence and awkward conversation. We pretended there was no issue, which probably made it even more awkward. After an hour or so things started to get a little bit more comfortable and we decided to go get something to eat. My Grandma picked the place since I am not from the area. We went to this really old diner. I was the youngest person there. It looked like the place hadn't been redecorated in decades. I felt completely out of place, but Grandma seemed happy. She was friends with all of the servers and other customers. It was nice to see her in her element. She was actual a nice lady, and somewhat pleasant to be around. After dinner we parted ways.

We didn't have too much time to get things together because my friends gave me really short notice. The birthday party was supposed to be a surprise, and I think we did a good job keeping it that way. His wife might have clued him in on the party, but even if so, he still acted surprised. I got to meet some really interesting people at the party that I had never interacted with before. Most notably was my sister in law's friend, who was full of energy. Even though I was exhausted from working a long shift, his energy was contagious and it really pepped me up and I was able to enjoy myself and have a great time with my loved ones. We had a caterer for the party who did quite a nice spread, with all kinds of food. I was adamant about there being vegetarian options, because I know a lot of people who might attend were vegetarian. Sometimes you go to parties with food and it's all meat, or just really boring stuff. But this caterer was particularly fancy, and we got a great deal because the lady who owns the business is a friend of mine. I overheard a lot of people talking about how great the food was. My brother got some really silly gifts. The most memorable was a teddy bear onesie. His friends made him put it on for the remainder of the party, which was really hilarious.","I had a birthday party that my friends and family organized.

My birthday was next weekend and I had planned with my partner to have a quiet day. But this morning he was acting strangely. He acted like he had some kind of secret that he was dying to tell me but and was struggling to restrain himself. He's never been good at keeping a secret. After receiving so many out of the ordinary texts, I suspected maybe I was in for a surprise party. While I do love a good surprise, I don't want to look a mess. I can look quite the fright after a day at work. My mother, who is in many ways my twin, realizes this, which is probably why she texted me. She didn't reveal anything specific but by simply texting me, I knew something was up. I decided to cut out of work a bit early and hit Nordstrom's before I went home. If there really were a bunch of people at my house waiting to yell ""Surprise!"" at me, I wanted to look good. I found a cute dress which I wore out of the store. I reapplied my makeup while in the parking lot. When I opened the door to my house at least 30 people jumped out at me. Balloons were releases and party horns were blown. My mother came up and gave me a hug. ""New dress huh?"" she asked smiling at me. ""Yep"" I replied, ""thanks for the heads up."" She smiled knowingly at me and handed me a glass of champagne.

3SKRO2GZ72DH2NNR3PD7YGXAVRFK1B,"I was on my daily game of Dota 2 last week and I had a very intense two hour game that is both stressful yet rewarding. It's always been stressful yet rewarding for me over the thousands of hours I have played in this game but my last week's game stands out than the rest. I picked Crystal Maiden as my hero and I went with another person who played a carry Slark at the bottom lane. My lane partner was very vocal on the team chat on how I am very inefficient and was stealing his experience points in the game. He did say something about how ""noob"" I am and grew more and more frustrated minute by minute. He was killed multiple times in the early game and of course, I was blamed for it. I did not let his words be a distraction nor a way to just give up and surrender. Even though I had a mic, I stayed quiet and just typed ""I'm sorry"" on chat whenever he screamed at me. Our towers are down but I kept optimistic on winning. Even though he was being angry at me and whenever I made I mistake I get bullied by him, he also never gave up and continued gaining experience and gold necessary for his hero to be powerful. The first time the enemy made a mistake and we won a team fight, I immediately congratulated our team for the great play and my other teammates were all audibly optimistic as well. Our carry Slark at this point has considerably limited his verbal abuse and I was sure that he will cooperate once he realized we were all there to win the game. The enemy had many more mistakes after that and we had a very satisfying comeback. I would always commend and rate positively my teammates whenever I win, so I did it as well with Slark. I was surprised that he did commend me back and got a friend request from him after the game. I did accept his friend requests and we've been playing a few more games to this day. I actually quite like his company and we enjoy our in-game banter and he actually jokes a lot with me now.","This is a story about a strong, young lad who handled a poor situation with dignity and honor.

Normal people aren't like this. I booked a therapist and waited and ate my way through the month until I could finally talk to her. I told her about my habits and my relationship with food. And I was right, there was something wrong with me. She told me I had something called a binge eating disorder. Being overweight and being told that I have an eating disorder was a shock.

She had spoken of you times and I was always sitting by her side just waiting for her to say something to me.  She was extremely drugged and incoherent and barely able to speak.

I love my coworkers, my duties, the environment I'm in. I couldn't think of a better place to work. Everything around me seemed pretty perfect. I was making good money, and having a good time while I was doing it. However, as they say, nothing lasts forever.

I remember coming home crying and feeling so embarrassed. I didn't even want to face my coworkers anymore after knowing they saw the way he had treated me. I didn't feel like showing up to work anymore, period! Later that day when I went home, I already began debating my future there. I knew my manager had treated other employees that way, but I just never thought it'd happen to me, since I always tried to be the best employee I could be.

She's just a little more forgetful than she used to be, which is dangerous when she needs to be on top of taking medication.

I tried to tough it out for a few days but it was no use, I had to have it looked at.

After being admitted and put in a gown and bed, the last meeting with the doctors took place. At the end of it the anesthesiologist asked a series of questions just as final confirmation. ""Are you allergic to any medications?"" No I replied. ""Do you have sleep apnea or any breathing disorders."" No I don't I said, thinking that I had already wrote this all in a questionnaire. ""Is there any possibility that you could be pregnant?"" No I am not pregnant I said. ""This is very important though, is there ANY possibility that you could be pregnant?"" Hmm I thought. I didn't feel pregnant, but then again I had never been before, how would I know? So I said ""yes, it's possible I suppose, what does that mean?"" I'll tell you what it means. It means that your knee surgery gets postponed while they administer a pregnancy test. It means they have to do a second test, and then a third one to confirm. It means I went for a simple surgery and instead found out I was 5 months pregnant. It turns out that they couldn't do the surgery when I was pregnant, the danger to the fetus was too great. My surgery was cancelled. After a closer examination of my knee they decided the problem with my knee could wait a few months for surgery, or may even resolve on its own with physiotherapy.

I looked at my phone and saw on my calendar that today was the big day I had been waiting for, after the past 4 years of responsible studying and grueling all night cram sessions. I was to receive my diploma, my B.A. in Computer Science, officially today on stage. I quickly got up, took a shower, brushed my teeth, got dressed and skipped to the kitchen to have breakfast. I lived alone, with just my dog, in a small apartment. So we enjoyed a lovely and quiet breakfast together. I later went for a walk with my best friend around the block, it helped to calm my nerves and expel the butterflies in my stomach, as well as calm down my furry friend. After our morning routine, I arranged my gown and cap, made sure to press them down, wrinkle free, and folded and packed them neatly to wear for later. I got in my car and drove to the graduation ceremony location, a large auditorium on campus that was usually reserved for putting on plays and concerts. I greeted my two best friends, Jared and Jake, and my scarce family there as well ; at the school. My family and I were a smaller than average bunch, with me being an only child and my father passing away at a early age, it was only my mom and my uncle there to cheer me on. I gave them both great big hugs and we took some pictures together with great big smiles. I left to get dressed up and ready for the ceremony. After getting dressed, we took our seats next everyone else in the large auditorium. The usual mandatory, long winded speeches were given, with our special guest speaker a famous vocalist who I cannot recall the name of, someone from American Idol I think. When the time finally came for us to walk up one by one to receive our diploma, I was a bit nervous and weary, as everyone before me had received such large applause and cheer from the crowd. With only two of my family members attending, I thought it might be a bit embarrassing to not have any sort of uproarious applause for my name being called. I got in line, and slowly proceeded to walk on stage, with our names being alphabetically announced, I was soon to be next. When my name was heard over the speakers, I was quite surprised and excited. What I thought would be a few claps, turned out to be an enthusiastic and encouraging applause of a multitude of people. I was humbled by the support and it gave me the confidence boost I needed to stride on stage and shake hands with my teachers with pride. I couldn't remove the large smile on my face for that entire day because of how nice everyone was to me and because of this moment, I will never forget the sense of exhilarated bliss that I experienced from not only the culmination of my 4 years of hard work, but the positive support of strangers, friends and family.",One's cannot be satisfied is proven on that day.

33JKGHPFYDGF6IUJTOOLA02HNYUMN7,"4 months ago my fiance proposed to me on a romantic getaway in Gatlinburg, Tennessee.  It was everything I had ever imagined since being a little girl. Although I had no idea he was about to pop the question, my whole family already knew. In fact, they spent the past year and a half helping my fiance in preparing what they knew would be my dream proposal. My fiance, Alex, started  our day by ordering us room service for breakfast. My mother told him I loved homemade french toast with strawberries so that is what we got. After breakfast Alex took me to the shopping mall and told me to pick out a nice gown for the evening. At this point I admit, I was a tad bit suspicious but I was still clueless that all of my dreams were about to come true.  After shopping, Alex took me to get my nails done. By this point it was 4pm and I was really starting to wonder what he was up to.  When we arrived home he suggested I get ready for dinner. When I got out of the shower he was gone. But there were rose pedals and lit candles leading up to a note and flowers.  The note had an address on it, so I quickly but carefully got dressed and did my makeup. I rushed down to the parking lot and headed to the address Alex had given me. Upon arrival I noticed there were no cars in sight. I entered the  building and was immediately escorted by a kind gentleman over to Alex. We spent the entire night laughing and joking and just all out enjoying ourselves. After  we ate he finally popped the question.  Then my entire family came from the back of the restaurant to photograph us and cry with us. I still cannot believe he flew my family all the way out to Tennessee just for our proposal. And I cant believe my family had been helping him this whole time! I am truly blessed. Since the proposal he has never failed to amaze me. Today is our wedding day and I cant wait to see what surprises are in store.",One's cannot be satisfied is proven on that day.

There were plenty of steaks to go around the whole family. There were some nice mashed potatoes to eat. They had gravy on the side. There was a big cake to share with everybody.

3HMIGG0U4MSUXSWT6PNDMYZSIU0Y8J,"Being talked down to by my older colleagues has been a constant theme in my career.   It's always seems to be the same scenario - they think I'm over confident.  About two months ago, I was given a peach assignment as a lead on a project.  I was so excited and energized while my colleagues were kind of resistent and downplayed the importance of the project.  They told me I was too optimistic because in the end the project would fail like all the other projects regardless of effort.  They told me it would be a big fall if I didn't come down from the clouds.  Instead of listening to them I started looking at the psychology behind their attitudes of impending failure.  I realized that they were missing the ""what's in it for me"" concept.  They saw no benefit for them to a lot of effort and hard work.  I saw this as a challenge.  How do I make them see their effort as a win?  How can I quantify and qualify the outcomes of their efforts.  I decided to make sure every project task completion had an outcome of reward both tangible and intangible.  I showed them how the effort and work they are doing benefits their customer, and themselves.  The reward of  successful completion leads to provable skill and knowledge.  I found the sweet spots of their sense of accomplishment and motivations and used it to garner their buy-in and support.  With everyone on the same page moving us toward success my colleagues were genuinely more helpful and excited to help me as a project lead.  In two months time the whole attitude of our team has changed.  They no longer see me as the young pup.  They h ave accepted me as a leader even though most of them are 20 years older than me.  I don't feel anxious and eager to please.  I have found their motiviations and I have earnestly tried to encourage and care for their successes as well as my own.  Last week I was able to provide a recommendation for a team member who intially had resisted the project because of her 180 degree turn around. Because of her changes in attitude she became a focal team member and will be leading her own project team soon.",A challenging obstacle made by my seniors in my work place and I faced the problem by my own with the help of my college professors and my friends.

Even though summer only ended 2 months ago I feel like it has been weeks and years since I was out in nature enjoying the beautiful weather and wind blowing on my face. One of my fondest memories this past summer was something that I saw outside my window. I peeked out of the kitchen window and looked out to see a rainbow in the sky. After enjoying the rainbow for some time I noticed there was a nest build on my window sill. I cannot believe I almost missed this beautiful sight. The mother bird was a rare shade of pink I have never seen before in nature only in the zoo. But the most majestic part of this experience was the eggs that laid peacefully still in the nest. The eggs were the bluest shade of blue I had ever seen before. I never pictured that a pink bird could lay such beautiful blue eggs. The mother bird was always so attentive to the nest and watchful over these eggs. Just before I left for holiday I saw an egg begin to crack. I unfortunately never got to see the birds hatch. I only wish I could have been there to see their birth and watch them fly off into the world.

3DUZQ9U6SNAVCIGXFC6YWQVZ3S3VS2,"Three weeks ago I went camping at a Texas state park with two siblings. It was a cool summer afternoon and it had just finished raining. We decided to pack up our things and take a spontaneous trip to the most remote part of Park. Once we arrived, we set our things down and set up camp. We unpacked the marshmallows and started up a fire. We sat around the fire and just talked. Talked about our childhood, jobs, girlfriends, sports, you name it. We talked away the afternoon and our nostalgic memories lit up our faces. Our past few years hadn't been easy, with Dad leaving us and mom being stressed out raising us alone. This was our chance to just forget about hardships and focus on our love. Finally we got up and hiked up the mountain before nightfall. Once we reached the apex, we were greeted by the most majestic view of the valley. The forest canopy glistened under the soft glow of the moonlight as far as the eye could. We gasped in delight. Finally it was time to go back. I wish we couldve stayed in that moment forever.","I went camping at a Texas state park with two siblings. We talked about nostalgic memories around a campfire.

3DH6GAKTYZB9HOXGFFNQZIWW9M1ZYD,"I remember three months ago I was in a terrible position because of something out of my control. It all started with my parents. They originally decided to move to Texas in 8 months and we planned around that date. However, at some point they decided that they had to move sooner. They said it was because of an offer they got on their house and they really didn't want to miss the opportunity to sell above market value. The problem is this was a very difficult position for me because I was budgeting to have enough money to move in eight months. When they moved up the date, I began panicking because I would not be able to afford to move to Texas with them and I would have no where to live if I stayed here. The whole situation turned out to be a really big strain not just on me but on my relationship with my parents. Having no choice but to move with them in a month and a half turned my life upside down. I turned to a friend of mine who I knew I could trust and I asked them what I should do. My friend told me I should make a decision based on reason and logic. He suggested I write down a list of all of the options I have and the pros and cons of each. That way, I could visualize the problem and have a better chance of making the right choice. By approaching it like a math problem and adding up the option with the most pros, I was able to make an informed decision. Even after using this strategy, I still took several nights to sleep on my decision just to make sure it was what I wanted to do. In the end, I decided to move with my parents and leave everything behind for a fresh start in Texas.","There was a plan in place for my parents to move to Texas where I had an 8 month window to save money. Suddenly they decided no, we need to leave now and the window dropped to a month and a half. That left me in a terrible financial situation and struggling to find a place to live.",90.0

As a father I became concerned, asked some questions and tried to Know what was wrong with my daughter. I took her to three different physicians within two weeks. And just two days after seeing the second doctor, on November 4th, 2000, she came home from basketball, where she was coaching her sister’s football team, and fell down to the ground. She had suffered from a massive heart attack because of using a drug called meth. We learned of her meth use in the ICU. She was in a coma. The doctor explained that they found methamphetamine in her system and that every time you use meth it damages your heart. And after she went to practice and worked hard for two hours, she came home and suffered a massive heart attack. She literally blew out the bottom of her heart. After several days her eyes opened and I asked the neurologist if she was waking up. He took my daughter’s head in his hands and gently rolled her head from side to side and every time he rolled her head her eyes would roll with the head. “That’s called doll eyes,” he explained.

It gives you a a panoramic view of Hershey through windows shaped like a Hershey's Kiss. I was highly impressed since he knows that is my favorite Hershey's candy and the views from the tower were very romantic at night. I was startled we he began to get down on one knee and present me with a ring in a special Hershey Kiss box. I started to shake and tremble before eventually saying yes.

She told me she couldn't leave him and that he promised to change. One night I get a phone call, a frantic phone call from one of their kids.

Her ""husband"" was still inside the house firing off shots randomly at the police when I got there. I couldn't tell if he was drunk or just dumb.  For some reason my sister thought it would be a good idea to struggle over the gun. That's when the police decided to storm the house. Inside they found two dead children, my nieces.

I was basically driving in circles. I found myself driving around in circles for about 30 minutes before I said it was enough, as my phone was dead, and had no idea how to read a map. I ended up pulling up to a rundown business, in the middle of no where, as I had no idea where I was. As I proceeded to enter, I got looks from all around the room, turns out it was a bar.

35DR22AR5E6JWQ0DPC6FC3K8001X33,"There comes a time in everyone’s life where we hit a complete dead end with our jobs. We start to feel unfulfilled, under-valued, and that we are not using all of our skills we spent so long honing for the workplace. This happened to me about 3 months ago, where I completely hit a wall in my job at the time. I had been working as a Staff Accountant for a nationwide retail pharmacy chain for about 4 years. I took the job right out of college and thought it would be great. It was a huge company so I knew my job would be stable, and if I wanted to move around a bit I figured that I would be able to. Well, after 4 years of small raises and no real big opportunities, I decided that it was time to chase my passion and look for new work about 3 months ago. I was such a small cog in this company since it was massive so I felt that my work was not meaningful. A family friend of mine had recently started a job in sales at a very small board company responsible for some big hit games, and they were looking to fill out their accounting department. Taking this job would be a risk, but board gaming is something I am passionate about and this company was so small. Anything I did in that job would be noticed by everyone. I would be making a real impact in my work. I decided to throw caution to the wind, and apply for the job. I've now been here for 2 months and I love it. The work I do is meaningful, I care about my company, and I am excited to come in to work each and every day. I am so happy I took this risk and chased my passion and left my dead end job.

We are from the southern United States and have never been to New York before so it was a new experience for the both of us. We have been to cities like Miami and Atlanta but New York is on a different level. We flew into JFK airport and then caught a cab to our hotel in Manhattan. Our jaws were open for the entire trip to the hotel. We have never seen so many people just walking to and fro, no matter what time of day it was. The energy level of the city is just insane. Once we checked into the hotel, we immediately headed back out to explore the city. Each day we sought to explore a different borough. We checked out Central Park and the zoo. We of course visited Lady Liberty herself and the One World Trade Center. We walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and took pictures of the water. We took the subway to Coney Island and rode on the ferris wheel until sunset. We walked down Wall Street and watched all the bankers and brokers run from office to office.

I always advised my daughter that if she ever comes into a situation where she does not agree with something, that she needs to take a moment and collect herself.

There was much excitement at the prospect of being exposed to a new culture, meeting new people and of course, the exotic destination. I had always been fascinated by Jamaican music and food but there’s something surreally authentic about experiencing these aspects directly in the native country and I just couldn’t wait for the plane to land in Montego Bay... woo hoo! As we checked into the hotel set in the midst of Palm trees and shimmering water, Dad winked at my brother and me, and told us to meet him and mom at the pool. My brother and I exchanged a knowing glance- it was a family tradition. Every year we voted on our vacation destination and upon getting there we planned our activities for the stay. Our folks encouraged us to steer clear of the usual touristy stuff and come up with novel ways to interact with the locals..... andddd this time I already knew what I wanted to do. Last year, after the trip was finalized, as part of a school project we were asked to make a pen pal from across the globe, and no prizes for guessing, I chose Jamaica, and hard as it is to fathom, Aiesha has become my best friend. The bond that forged between us through the exchange of snail mail and this trip planned to her hometown seemed like the most wonderful of synchronicity! Everyone except for my brother was excited when I suggested we visit Aiesha at her school but it was my mom’s idea to bring supplies to the local school which in retrospect turned out to be a lesson I will never forget. After the initial yawn-yawn, my brother got into it and we really enjoyed shopping for the school supplies. The visit to the local school, meeting Aiesha in person, distribution of the supplies directly to the students and their euphoria at receiving gifts from friends from another country is etched in my mind forever. Words truly cannot capture how happy I was, but it truly was an unforgettable trip!!! Aiesha and my friendship continues to deepen.

The difference with today's visit was the person or client that I met while I was there. We sat and chatted for a while and I learned about all the tribulations this person endured in his home country.  It was very upsetting to see someone go through such terrible trials but he was here now and we were one our way to better things. I never realized how bad things can be for a person outside our country.  You really can't get the true meaning until you hear it first hand.  To think so many people are going through this is heart breaking. Sometimes I wonder why it has to be this way. Why can't people just treat others with tenderness? It is not that hard to do.  I suppose money and power play a huge role.  So I listened to this man tell me story after story. He talked about his family. He talked about his neighbors. Some stories were not so bad.

351SEKWQS136K6364UAIEVQMCUEDM3,"Last night, I went out to celebrate a birthday party with a few close friends and had a great time. We had such a fun time performing karaoke on stage with several people like we were in a karaoke band. It was an all out concert experience with complex lighting, smoke machine, and a cheering crowd. We all drank a bit too much throughout the night that by the end of the party I was pretty trashed and so were my buddies. As the party dwindled down and some people had left the bar, I decided to call an Uber just to get home safely. While waiting for the Uber my friend Dan had called my cell phone to let me know that he was at the police precinct a few blocks down from the bar and needed my help. He explained that he had been pulled over by an unmarked police car at a stop sign. The officer said he smelled of alcohol so he needed to take a field sobriety test, which he failed and was immediately arrested. So Dan asked if I could bail him out and wanted me to pick him up from the precinct when they released him in a few hours. However, there was a problem because I had left my car at the bar parking lot since I was also drunk. Anyway, I promised him I'd be there to bail him out and take him home. I told the Uber driver to take me to an ATM where I took out $200 for Dan's bail, then immediately driven to the precinct to pay it. While waiting for him, I slept in a chair in a waiting area where he was released to me 4hours later. I called an Uber driver to pick us up and bring us to my apartment so we could get some rest.

3GNA64GUZFQ218M5HHZGXSMZGN1Q58,"My personal life story begins like all of us at my birth. Being born in a small village in the West African country of Ghana gives me my uniqueness and an identity that has culture, history and politics in it. The village is called Dixcove after the British Captain who was called Captain Dixon who colonised the region in the 16th Century. My Mother is a Ghanaian and my Farther is from England, the North West a West Cumbrian. When I was four it was decided by my parents that I would live in England with my dad’s sister my Auntie Dot. ‘It was for the best reasons’ I have remembered my Auntie saying and after all it was the brave new world of the nineteen sixties, where the ‘civil rights’ movement was in its ascendency. Being sent to live in Egremount in West Cumbria had a number of challenges, not just for its white working class identity which served up a lot of prejudice for me; it was also the beginning of the sexual abuse that I had to endure as a child. My Auntie had two Sons and one Daughter. This was my home and where I lived with them, my cousins, my Auntie and my Uncles. From the age of seven up until the age of ten I was sexually abused by one of the boys on a weekly basis, apart from a three month period in each year. I was forced to act out sexual favours for him. He was eighteen at the time and the abuse would always happen in mine and my dad’s room. This is mentioned for the reason of if I was reading this I may ask ‘where was my dad when this was happening? Dads are supposed to protect you aren’t they?’ He lived in Ghana working and living with my Mum where he would spend nine months in Ghana and three months in England. As a black child, young adult who had no black friends, no black family members or black role models there has been a visible lack of ‘group identity’. My contact with blackness was watching Muhammad Ali win the heavy weight championship of the world, the Jackson Five singing ABC and the Brazilin footballer Pele being my school nickname given to me by my white peers. Having to live with experiencing sexual abuse has had a huge effect on me; anger, depression and anxiety have been emotions which were hard for me to live with but easy for me to relate to. Even so the sexual abuse had not affected the real sense of ‘uniqueness’ my situation gave me. It did not matter that there was a lack of blackness in my world to relate to, both subtle and overate messages every day gave negative, positive assurance of my sense of self, I felt black, it was certainly not the case of being proud of this fact after all I had been sexual abused as a child. Self-image has direct long term impact on self-esteem and is vital in helping a healthy development. When my cousin who sexual abused me told me ‘if I spoke to anyone about the sexual abuse no one would believe me because I was an outsider, a brown bugger no one wanted’ his words stopped me from saying anything to anyone.",The visitors who had come to my place prayed for use and it all went  well.

I love to be able to provide for everyone in my family because it makes me feel important and like I matter to them. In my job as a PSE, I have to determine whether people qualify for government issued benefits. Not everyone qualifies, but everyone is always able to apply. It is a particularly difficult job that I wish paid more than it did. That doesn't mean I dislike it though. I wake up every day waiting for the new challenge that awaits me at work.

I was very scared but also very excited.  How nice would it be to get up and not ever go to work again! I know there would be some challenges along the way but I was ready for my new adventure. I started by meeting with my boss who is a very nice person.  She wasn't very shocked. She told me she was mentally preparing herself for months for this conversation.  We laughed and talked a while.  Next I told my close co-workers and before I knew it the entire company was at my desk congratulating me.  It felt so nice that everyone was happy for me. I decided to stay a few months to get others up to speed and trained. I really didn't want to leave anyone high and dry. The last day of my job was so sad but exciting.

It makes me laugh now when I think about it because with Laila and Marcus from my previous marriage, I always said to him those two were the best behaved children ever, and I didn't want to jinx my luck by having any more.  I couldn't believe how insistent he was that we just had to have another baby to unite our kids and complete our little blended family.  Sure enough though after months of trying to convince me that this would be good for us, I finally gave in to the idea.  But, then I thought about it again, diary:  Did I really want to have to worry about Pediatricians again?  Daycare costs again?  Especially after I'd gotten comfortable with having older kids that I practically grew up with!  I was in such a good place.  The weird thing about it all is that I remember he and I were together and I just knew what he was trying to do.  At first, I was skeptical, but then I began getting excited about the possibility of having his baby.  After all we didn't have one together, and our blended family was working so well that we both knew it was right.

Eventually, I began to accept the fact that at 35 years old, I didn't NEED to have another baby at all, and this was life's way of saying that I wasn't suppose to have another baby.  I was OKAY with that Diary!!!  We enjoyed our life and family time. It's just funny how Dana's baby shower changed it all for us for some reason.  When I came home that night from Norfolk, and I began telling him about the shower and how excited Sasha and her husband were and how cute the gifts were, I could see just feel the idea of having another baby getting him worked up and excited.  I guess I shouldn't have been surprised that that was the night our little man was conceived!

I was a psychology major, but I wasn't able to pass my math class so I had to switch to sociology. Before the change, I was really nervous and unsure of myself. I tried to find comfort in the familiar stuff in order to cope. When I would get anxious, I was lucky to be surrounded by people that were supportive. My fiance would often play board games with me and that helped a lot. I found that petting my guinea pigs really helped me out too. In the moment, the anxiety felt very intense but I was able to overcome it for the most part. Although it never fully went away, I got better with dealing with it as time went on.  After switching to my sociology major, I found that a lot of my teachers were very nice. The homework got easier for me, and it felt like it was a major that I belonged in. Although I initially wanted to study psychology, sociology was a good compromise. They are two related fields that are similar in some regards.

34J10VATJGKEDWHKO1IAM1Q4LJQQIL,"I had graduated from college a few months ago, in an education-related field, and I had secured a position as a student teacher in a new city on the East Coast. Things went well at the start. Even though the city was a large, and expensive one, I had gotten an Airbnb for a few weeks, to stay at while I looked to sign a lease at an apartment. Rents were very expensive, which I expected, and many areas were places that I wouldn't consider living because of noise, crime, and similar factors. Still, I was able to find a  semi-reasonable, comfortable, place within a week. So finding a place to live was going well. The student teaching job, was another matter entirely. My adviser had assured me that the program I had selected, was going to start in the Fall, which was a couple of months from now, so I went about buying furniture and stuff for my new apartment. Not long after that, I happened to be looking at the courses I was scheduled to teach on the college employee portal, and I saw there were several course conflicts; I had been scheduled to teach more than one class, in the same time slot. It also turned out that these classes weren't for the Fall semester, but they were starting in the Winter. I was receiving a grant for housing assistance and living expenses, dependent on starting teaching in the Fall, and my savings were limited, so this was going to create problems very soon. I went to the campus and spoke to my adviser, and at first tried to insist that this was the course schedule I had selected. After that, he blamed a 'problem with their computer system.' Finally he told me that he had indeed made a mistake, but the Fall schedule had been set, so at this point there was nothing he could do. I found myself in a strange city, with bills I would soon be unable to pay, and no clear purpose for being there for the immediate future.

Dealing with maternal cancer can cause distress and anxiety because this illness is usually associated with poor prognosis, agonizing pain, negative effects of the treatment, and low survival rates. Cancer is considered by many as a “silent killer,” which unsuspectingly ravages the body from within. It can be a stressful experience, not only for the patients themselves, but also for the entire family. Every member of the family, especially the children, has to adjust to the emotional burden, physical demands, and lifestyle changes which cancer brings about. The occurrence of cancer has alarmingly increased throughout the years, affecting and claiming many lives around the world. It has been estimated that around 12. 2 million people are diagnosed with cancer worldwide (American Cancer Society, 2007). It is also projected that the number of cancer cases and deaths will continue to escalate in the future. New cancer cases are estimated to increase from 11. 3 million in 2007 to 15. 5 million in 2030 (WHO, 2008).

I really felt betrayed when he told me that he had contracted an STD. I was scared for my own health and angry at him because I know that he did not get the STD from me. He was honest with me about cheating on the ski trip and I believe that he truly was remorseful. I wish that i could find it in my heart to forgive that and continue a relationship with him. I can't find anyway to see that as tolerable and it continues to be a line crossed that I cannot move past. I feel like he still wanted to be with me and that he respected my wishes and understood my hurt in allowing our relationship to end. I wish that he would have fought for me but it makes me feel that he truly did care for me that he respected how I feel. I keep comparing any new potential relationships to him and there is always something that makes me hesitant. This guy is too tall, that guy is too skinny, this one isn't smart enough, that one is too cocky, but in reality every excuse should be that they are not Anthony. It is frustrating for me that I find myself in a situation where I want something that I will not allow myself to have. Truly does feel like a fight between my heart and my mind. I know that I will ALWAYS suspect him of cheating again and that I can never fully trust him like I did before he cheated.

I could barely understand what she was saying, but after a bit I learned that her grandfather had passed away.  This was a man she was quite close to as she spent a lot of her summers growing up with her grandparents.  It had happened suddenly, so she didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

So the boys decided to take me to Niagra Falls for the weekend. From the moment I left my apartment until the moment I left Niagra Falls was an absolute blast. We drove up there togther, all of us piled into the SUV like a bunch of teenagers. We partied like rockstars. Seeing the falls was so awe inspiring too. It really helped sober us up. Just enough to go back to the bar that afternoon and get drunk again. We even smoked a little weed for old times sake. We hot boxed that SUV like we were in high school over again.

It has been hard to find enough time to get away from work to go see her. She lives in Europe now and I need a lot of vacation time to be able to get over there and see her. Anyway, when I finally arrived there she seemed not that that excited to see me. When we were kids we were very close we did things together all of the time and I was so excited to catch up with her. When I got there she seemed like she was afraid of her husband or something. She didn't talk much as he was a big talker. I think he may have her brainwashed or something. I have never seen her act like this. It breaks my heart to see her as a shell of her former self. I hope she does something to fix this as I don't want to completely lose my sister.

For a few months I had been putting a few dollars out of every pay check to a secret account in order to get him something that he's been dreaming of for decades. Since he was a boy he always wanted to get a motorcycle. He had posters of it on his wall and watched movies about it. His family wouldn't let him even think about it, but he vowed to get one as soon as he turned 18. Unfortunately, life did not turn out the way he wanted it to. He wanted the motorcycle, but his first priority was to get get an education, so he said he'd get one after college. After college, he didn't have enough money so he started to work when he met me and our priorities changed. First was the wedding, then the house. Then I got pregnant and the priorities changed again. After Ashley, our little girl turned 4, he started talking about the motorcycle again, but I was scared. A few weeks later, we got a big shock. Ashley was going to be a big sister! There went the priorities again. We bought a bigger house. A bigger car. We adopted a puppy from the shelter. Our lives got bigger, full of more and more. But not the motorcycle. That bike was still on his mind. A few months back, I went through all our accounts. Ashley is in college and Michael was in high school with his own job. Finally it was time!

When he asked me out on a date to a really fancy Italian restaurant, I was so happy to get to go some place nice and dress up and spend time with Justin. Justin was going to love seeing how pretty I looked in it. I spent an hour getting ready for the date, fixing my hair and getting my makeup looking perfect. Then, it was time. Justin showed up to pick me up, and we headed to the restaurant. This was a restaurant I've always wanted to eat at, but the prices were pretty high, so it was definitely a special occasion restaurant. But I'd heard good things and really wanted to eat there. We got to the restaurant and it was looking really fancy. Justin ordered my favorite wine and we had a good laugh about what we'd both done all day. The food came out and it was really delicious. The night was magical so far, but after dinner, Justin took me to the beach. It was one of the nicest beaches in Florida, and the view was amazing. We were looking out over the water, and just then fireworks went off. They were so beautiful. I looked over at Justin, and he was down on the ground on one knee. Then a chill came over my body once I realized what was happening. He opened a small box and inside was the most gorgeous diamond ring. He then asked me to marry him. I was flooded with so much emotion and began to cry. In that moment, I had no doubts about him and knew he was the perfect man for me. So of course I said yes.

She said he doesn't give us any money and that he ran off with some younger women who is like half his age. I know she doesn't make a lot of money and she tries her best to get things for me but we're lucky if we actually have food in the house lately. She has to get her car fixed so she could get to work and that pretty much tapped her out for the next three months. She is a waitress so she said she'll pick up some extra shifts to get more tips to pay things off.

In my drunken state, I decided that I should walk home. I lived close enough to the bar that it would be about a 20 minute walk home. On the way walking home, I tripped over a place where the concrete slabs were uneven. I fell to my right, and into a chain link fence, in front of the house on my street. As I stood back up, I could feel a lot of pain in my arm, and as I reached up I could feel blood on that part of my arm. I couldn't really see the cut since it was dark on the street, but I figured I must have scrapped my upper arm along a sharp piece of the fence.

Fortunately for our family, he got there in the nick of time. He is resting, recuperating, and responding to treatment and prognosis is looking great for a full recovery.

3BF51CHDTWWQT8111L6A7JY71KQ0HA,"My brother had been having a hard time since his wife died in a car accident. He lives in Colorado, which is about a seven hour drive away from the rest of his family, who all live in South Dakota. He works full time, and before the accident, his wife was a stay at home mom to their three year old twin daughters. The tragic accident happened the summer before my daughter's senior year of high school. Honestly, it was added stress on me because I was currently very worried about the direction my daughter's life was heading. She only needed two more credits to graduate, but she was already talking about how much she didn't want to go back to school and wanted to just drop out and get her GED. However, when my daughter heard about the death of her aunt, she immediately decided that she would move to Colorado for her senior year and help her uncle adjust to his new way of life. She had always had a very strong bond with her cousins, and I knew it broke her heart that they lived far away. She helped my brother find a day care that was near a high school so that she could drop off her cousins on her way to school and pick them up after her two classes. Two months ago, I went to Colorado to watch her graduate. She walked across the stage hand in hand with her cousins. I was so unbelievable proud of my daughter for taking the initiative to help the people she loves while also doing what was best for her and her future. What made it even better was that I could tell that my daughter was just as proud of herself. I could tell that the struggle of facing an adult like life had made her more mature. But the most important thing to me was that my daughter was truly happy and proud of what she had accomplished.",The event was about my daughter's walking across the stage. She was out in Colorado for her senior year in high school with my brother.,60.0

Part of growing up involves facing difficult or challenging moments and finding a way through those hard times. Signs of maturity include flexibility, adaptability, and resilience, and college is the ideal time to work on these skills. But if situations escalate to the point at which they threaten your child's physical or mental health—or put them in jeopardy—step in and offer aid. But ask for permission first. You want to support your child as much as possible but not to the extent that you dismantle the initial foundation of self-sufficiency. Finding the right balance will take time, but eventually, you'll both get there.","I went to my cousin's wedding and met a woman that was out of my league.

I had done it, I had gone through all of the things I needed to do to get to this point in life, too. I made myself proud and others as well. It was a long and gruelly process but sometimes the things that take the longest to transpire are worth the wait. One of the most interesting things that happened during the search was the most memorable ever for me. This was when I met my long time friend from years ago again. His name is Pete. Somehow we lost contact. He and I went to High School together, when we met again he told me about a house that was up for sale after meeting him again in a grocery store. He only lived about two blocks away. Since then we have gotten together a few more times and plan to date again. Now I can truly say I am happy with what I have chosen, and this house will be mine to live in for the rest of my life. Not only that but I have rekindled a good friendship that might turn out to be something more.  This is what intriques me about life in general.",I spent a long time finding a house to purchase.

It was nice not to deal with so many people and I was able to sleep through part of it, so the day wasn't ruined.  My friend Mike from college picked me up and we went downtown for breakfast.  He and I chilled at his apartment and caught up for a few hours until the afternoon.  We met up with some of his friends in the city and saw a UFC headline match.  I decided to put money on some of the fights and got lucky.  It was foolish but hey, I was there to have fun and it wouldn't have cost much more to lose anyway.  I ended up winning about $50.  We hit up a couple bars afterward and had a nice time.  I wandered around a bit over the next couple days.  I didn't have much of an itinerary and it was nice not to have anything in particular to do until the weekend.  I spent almost a whole day at The Mall of America - it was huge, even larger than I was expecting it to be.  I went to see The Specials on Thursday as part of their 40th anniversary tour.  I like ska, and I don't listen to it much at home, but the show was fun and the music sounded pretty good in person, so I enjoyed myself.  On Friday and again on Saturday I met up with family outside the city.  It was a reunion party and we were able to spend it outside in the sun both days.  I played a lot of horseshoes and frisbee.

The hum of excitement at the race track was palpable, and I could barely contain myself as I got into my vehicle and the announcer counted down for the race. I slammed down on the accelerator and began to soar forward, the other racers becoming blurs around me as speed became the only thing on our minds. Everyone knew the stakes, this was a national race, any victory here would result in fame or fortune for the driver, and opening the door to something lifechanging. Distance wise, these races aren't very long, neither are they time-wise, really. But after spending so much time practicing, so much time racing, I've learned that no matter how long the race actually is, it always takes so much time to really get through it. Seconds pass like hours as I realize that I don't think that I'm passing anyone. The other racers edge forward ahead of me, and I keep slipping further and further back, my future slipping away slowly. As the race came to an end, and it was locked in that I lost the race so early on, I was a bit disappointed. But at the same time, I was proud.

Everything seemed to be going in slow motion as the doctor was talking about what the disease was, I did not even hear him tell me what it was. I was thinking if it was a fatal disease, or if it would change my quality of life. I just shook my head and the doctor tried to calm me by saying ""don,t worry we will do our best to help!"" I left and went and picked up my prescriptions. I sat at home by myself staring into the nothingness of my emotions thinking about what will become of me and my newly discovered disease.

The pastor said that ""these circumstances aren't here to hold you back; but here to propel you forward to your purpose.""

I broke out one of the old board games me and my brother used to war over as children, and we all set up shop near the living room window. Naturally, I went easy on them (and I would never admit to being beat!). We had great fun, and it was wonderful to see little reflections of our childhood selves in her -- even down to the big huffy pout when things didn't go her way. We all lost ourselves in the game so much we barely even touched the food. I'll have to pack some of it up and hand it out in the break room at work, unless I really want to balloon up. It was long after sundown by the time we gave our farewells, along with a promise to get together again next month. We all made some precious memories that day, and I can't wait to see my niece continue to grow!","My brother and four year old niece visited for the first time in a year, and we were able to bond during her visit.

I've been going on these trips again and I feel like my life is so much better now. I'm more optimistic. I also feel like I function better.

We walked down a dirt road in my neighborhood where I knew we would see many interesting things including an old cemetery at the end of the road. This cemetery was what I would call a ""farmer's cemetery"" as most of the people listed on the tombstones were related and multi-generational and it was built on some old farmland. My grandson and I read some of the tombstones and discussed some of the ages when people died and were buried there. We came across a tombstone of a boy who died at age 5, the same age as my grandson. My grandson had a difficult time understanding how someone his age could have died. He said he thought only old people, like me!, died. I explained there were lots of reasons why a young person could die, such as an accident, disease, illness, etc.  He seemed to be surprised but also enlightened to his mortality. I was surprised that he believed only old people could die. The only people he knows who have died were all elderly, so it makes sense. It was also surprising that he considers me old.

Eventually the conveyor belt was empty, without our bags.  We went to the customer service desk, and they told us our bags had been taken to Chicago instead.  Everything was in those bags...clothes, toothbrushes, etc.   We had nothing! We were told our bags would arrive in two days, so we unfortunately spent our first night of vacation going shopping for necessities to hold us over until our bags arrived.

369J354OFEW77NS5J449VKWYX7B6GY,"Last fall, my family made the decision to put our long time family home up for sale. Because my siblings had already left the house and I was going to be leaving for college the following fall, my parents were ready to downsize. It was an emotional decision because my siblings and I had been raised in this home and my parents had lived there before any of us were even born. So last winter we set our sights on fixing anything that needed fixing in order to put our home up for sale. This included painting the walls, a new roof, and new siding in some areas. At the end of winter, our house was ready for the real estate market. We were all very anxious about putting the house on the market. My parents began looking for a new place to live and my siblings and I were trying to imagine a world in which we did not come home to the house we had grown up in and made so many memories in. After a couple of months on the market and a price drop, the home finally had an offer at the beginning of summer. But that is also where the headache began for myself and my parents. The people who put in the offer made too many demands including leaving some furniture and appliance items that we had planned to take with. After we conceded to some of what they wanted, the process of them getting verified to actually by the house turned in to a long drawn out process. In fact, mid way through summer my parents were just ready to be done with it as they had envisioned it going much smoother. My parents had to resign documents many times and were continuously told that the final offer might not go through, so they were stuck between purchasing their new home or waiting. Finally, at the tail end of summer, just as I was heading off to college, the offer went through and my parents were given 30 days to leave the home. By that point, I was already preparing to leave for college so it didn't seem to take as much of a toll on me as I thought it would. My parents were so fed up with how the process went, that they too were ready to say goodbye.

We had had three storms in a row and I had all the plowing and roof shoveling I could handle. The money was good, but it was exhausting work. On Sunday, I could not wait to get home because my dog, Scarlet, was new to the family and I knew she needed some company. I got home and Scarlet was so happy to see me that she was quivering. I took her out so she could do her business and that didn't take long. I sense she is not fond of the cold and snow. We got back inside and I got her some food and fresh water while I heated up a bowl of homemade chili, I had leftover. I was cold inside and out and just wanted to relax. The night was perfect to get a nice hot fire going in the fireplace. I piled in some dry kindling and a few seasoned pieces of ash and the fire was crackling and burning beautifully. I got up to go fetch my chili and when I came back into the room, I saw that Scarlet was hiding behind the chair shaking with a fearful look on her face. I set my bowl down and got down close to her to comfort her. I am not sure of her first year and what she went through before I rescued her from the shelter. I have seen occasional things that seemed to trigger some anxiety, but not like this. I think it may have been the sound of the fire and the intense warmth in the beginning. I picked her up like a baby and held her in my arms and sat on the couch. She was a bit uneasy, at first, but talking to her and taking occasional bites from my bowl of chili, she seemed to calm down and she looked up at me, with a knowing look in her eyes and I felt her tail wagging ever so slightly. I rubbed her belly with one hand and finished my chili with the other hand. As soon as I put my spoon in the empty bowl, she jumped up and licked a bit of chili off my chin, I had dribbled, and then didn't stop there. She licked my face all over. I had not seen her that happy since I walked through the door earlier. She, eventually, calmed down and curled up under my arm and we both drifted off to sleep.","I had a long day out in the snow and the cold.

The reality shows, infomercials and seminars all make it out to be so much easier than it actually is. I should have known better, but I was just too excited for the life change I always dreamed of. To be fair, purchasing the first home was easy... too easy. I should have seen the warning flags, but nope, excitement clouded my judgement. The price was great and at first glance the home was in pretty good condition, but that was just a facade. There were so many problems hidden in the walls and beneath the floors; electrical issues, unfinished plumbing, poor insulation, rot in the floorboards. I should have hired an inspector before purchasing, but was worried it would be snapped up by some other conniving entrepreneur. I won't lie and say I took it all in stride; I didn't handle it very well at all first honestly. But, after longer than I'd like to admit, I realized the only path forward was to get to work on the home and try to save myself from this disaster. It's been a hard half year, but it's finally coming together. I had to get another job, take out some loans, and all my spare free time has been spent working on the home myself (at least the parts I didn't need to hire an outside contractor for), but we're finally coming up to the finish line. There's still some aesthetic touch ups left to do, and I'll probably spruce up the yard a bit more, but as soon as the inspector comes by and gives me the a-okay, this house will be going back on the market. Will I end up making a profit? That would be nice, but trying not to be overly optimistic for now. At the very least I know I'll be able to wipe out my newfound debt and recoup at least a good bit of my investment. Will I buy another home after I am free of this short nightmare? I don't know. I haven't given it too much though. I definitely have more experience now and that would help, and I definitely don't want to spend my life as an hourly wage slave, but the magic of the idea has worn off. I guess I'll just see how I feel once I no longer have this burden on my shoulders.",I dreamed of starting my own business and taking on a project solely run by me. I wanted to flip homes as my primary career with building a real estate property firm and I took the chance with all of my life savings to purchase a home and do so.,180.0
3WR9XG3T64XAZ7DQ7D70S9ZR18T747,"I was so excited to get tickets to the music festival in Atlanta four months ago. It was going to be a long trip and I knew I'd be tired by the time I got there, but the chance to see all the different bands playing in one arena was too good to pass up. I decided to leave the day before the festival began. Camping sites were to be provided at the venue, I could get some rest in before the festival started. I was up and on the road by five in the morning, and only stopped for gas or food. I arrived at the camp site early in the evening, and proceeded to set up camp. Proceeded means try, doesn't it? First, while I had brought the tent, the pegs were nowhere to be found. My mind was filled with mages of bears sending my tent rolling downhill with me in it. That sent me to a nearby store in search of tent pegs! Pegs located, I finally got the tent set up. I took the car and went in search of something for dinner and a couple six-packs. I decided on hotdogs and marshallows over the fire for my meal.  Once I actually got a fire started it was an enjoyable evening. As it turned out, though, hotdogs and beer might mix well at a ballgame, but maybe not so much in the middle of a campground! When I woke up the day of the festival, my head was pounding and my stomach felt like it was being squeezed by giant pliers. I managed to drag myself to the car and went in search of breakfast and a couple more sixpacks. After refreshing myself, I packed up the car and headed out for the festival. It was so crowded that when I finally found a place to sit, I could barely see the stage.  The sound though, was awesome! I couldn't believe it when I ran into my next-door neighbor at a concession stand! Bob and his wife were both there, along with a couple of his friends from work. It was nearly time for my favorite band to take the stage so I said goodbye to Bob, and headed back to my seat. The band was fantastic, as expected, and the entire crowd was on its feet for the duration. Happy and exhausted, I left the festival grounds and went back to the motel room I had taken the precaution of rentinf for the night, and was soon sound asleep.",I drove a long time to go to a festival. I had hard time setting up camp. I drank a lot of alcohol. I saw a band I loved and was very happy.,120.0

My kids and I all got strawberry because that's our favorite. I love that I got to spend extra time with my kids and share that special memory with them. Ice cream is always good, it's even better when you have someone you love to share it with. The kids were all so excited and I loved just sitting and watching them run around with smiles on their faces, enjoying a break from their school routine and a refreshing scoop of ice cream as well. My kids and I say under the shade of a tree for almost an hour talking and reading a book together while we ate. We laughed together and talked about what we would do the following weekend. It was very relaxing. Some of the other kids ran around the playground and went on the swings and slides. They all had a great time. Once thing that shocked me was how clean all the kids were by the end of the outing. I was expecting sticky hands and faces and lots of ice cream stained shirts. I even brought wet naps, just in case, but they were all clean as a whistle. The greatest part of the ice cream day was that we raised enough money to fix the ceiling in the school library! I was shocked. I thought it would help us towards our goal, but I never thought we'd actually raise all of it. It was a day I will never forget!","The strawberry ice cream day was about me and my children having a good time eating ice cream and enjoying each others company.Eating snacks are fun when you have somebody to share it with.

It was several times over, I believe 4 times total. It was funny while at the same time a bit shocking. I had never been to a wedding with such a show before. I felt sorry for them.

3DQQ64TANH7BEF0AD570NN92WUTPWK,"My friends Sarah and William have never been to the United States.  When William had the opportunity to interview at the Chicago branch of his firm he was able to work in a visit to us in Grand Haven Michigan.  One of the first places we spent the day was the beach at Grand Haven.  We haven't seen in each other in person for such a long time that we spent half the day just talking at picnic table in the shade while watching the windsurfers play.  My partner Jamie knew of a little place we could get great sandwiches and picked them up for everyone as we scouted out a place on the beach to set up for the day.  Even though the beach was busy it was very relaxing.     If you've never been to a winery I can tell you that Traverse City has some fabulous locations to visit.  This was on Sarah's wish list and we were more than happy to take them up North to experience everything the near upper peninsula had to offer.  We left in the late afternoon to check into our hotel to visit the wineries early the next day when they opened.  On the drive there we took a detour to stop at Sleeping Bear Dunes.  William is a hobby photographer and really wanted to see a sunset from this vantage point.  It was a trek to the best location but it was amazingly worth it.  I think we were all ready to a good nights rest after the travel and hiking that day.  The wineries the next day were equally amazing and we learned a lot about the wines are made.  At least a couple of us enjoyed ourselves a little too much so it was a great idea that we'd decided to Uber from the hotel and back again.  They have some amazing restaurants in TC so after we had a couple hours to recover we took them to out favorite spot in town.  It was pretty busy for being the middle of the summer so we had to wait a little bit, but it was worth it.  They specialize in locally grown and sourced foods and really care about the quality and presentation.  We were happy our friends could experience this on their first trip to the states.      With only a few days of their trip left we took them up to Mackinaw Island for a day trip to experience what it's like to ride in a horse drawn carriage, and to ride on bikes to get where you need to go.  We had so much visiting all of the charming shops and taking in the scenery.  We were fortunate we had gorgeous weather that wasn't too hot for June.       We had such an amazing time visiting with out Irish friends that we're already talking about finding away to visit them in Ireland before they potentially end up moving to the states.    We're fortunate they were able to visit us in the summer when our state really shines!

3GFK2QRXXA37L5IRTQYMPH4MUTFW5H,"Three months ago, in the middle of October, my son James had become really oppositional to our family rules and especially to my requests. I am not sure what participated this change, likely it was because my son started middle school and his personality has become much more defiant. I'd expected some personality changes as my son moved past elementary school but it's been really beyond the pale. I should have expected worse. Anyway, our relationship reached an all-time low in October as my son flippantly told me that he was going to go to a Halloween party with his friends from school as if he didn't need my permission. I don't know all of these friends and I don't know the parents where the party was going to be hosted. I voiced my concerns to my son. I told him that I had to check first before agreeing to anything. I thought it was a minor and reasonable thing but my son raised his voice and accused me of being controlling. He stormed upstairs to his room and I followed him trying to explain the issue that I have with him being up at all hours with people I don't know. James apparently had enough and he slammed his bedroom door shut, nearly hitting my face in the process. Now, I try to be patient when dealing with my son but this was too much for me. I admit I shouted and my voice was several decibels higher than what it should have been. I shouted at James that avoiding me isn't going to solve the problem and slamming his door just meant that he is going to lose his privacy. I collected myself, went downstairs to the basement, grabbed a screwdriver and hammer, and went back to James' bedroom door. I had his door off its hinges in about 30 seconds. With privacy being one of the most important things to James, this was intolerable to him. He acted as if the world was ending. However, I stood firm and explained that actions have consequences and shutting the door in my face means that he loses his door until he can close it properly. I'd expected this to be a short term, temporary thing, but it seemed to have brought about a change in James. He calmed down over the next few days and we actually had a pleasant dinner for once.  I put the door back on its hinges a few days later and James hasn't slammed his door since.

When we woke up in the morning we were still quiet, but not disrespectful to the other. After I prepared breakfast, we finally sat down and calmly discussed our own roles. With that knowledge we had finally come to a conclusion. By admitting our own faults, we were able to understand the full story.","My wife and I were fighting.

3TXWC2NHN0CXFB3UCB124862K75S9Q,"We were coming home from a party with a couple of girls who typically hang out with us after-hours. My roommates Pete, Jim and Bob (who we all call Lude) had gone with me to a party at my friend Lisa's house. At the party, we met up with Ann and Chris, two girls who hang out with us a lot. Ann and I used to be romantically involved a few months ago, but we're just friends now. Chris and Pete have had an on-again, off-again relationship. When we got back to the house, my roommate John, who had not attended the party with the rest of us, was there drinking beer with several of his friends that I didn't really know. One of John's friends seemed to take a liking to Chris and was chatting her up outside on the patio.  She seemed interested in him. Pete noticed the interaction and started drinking a lot of bourbon, perhaps because he had hoped to have sex with Chris that night and saw that he had competition. As the night wore on, we all had become pretty drunk, especially Pete. The first guy who had been hitting on Chris ended up leaving with her. Pete had been distracted with something else and didn't notice until they had been gone for several minutes. When he figured out that Chris had left with another guy, Pete went kinda crazy. He started blaming our roommate John for bringing those strange guys to the house. Pete started yelling right in John's face, and John got very agitated. A fight between Pete and John seemed likely to break out, but a second and third guy that we didn't really know, walked up and settled the situation down by separating Pete and John. However, a fourth guy was disappointed that Pete and John had decided not to fight. He tried to agitate them into fighting by saying some really insulting obnoxious things about Chris and Ann, but a fifth and sixth guy came in a tried to shut up the fourth guy. The fourth guy and the sixth guy, who seemed to known each other fairly well, took exception to each other, and the sixth guy got really angry. The sixth guy really lost his cool and started throwing stuff around the patio area. It looked like they would come to blows, but they managed to avoid each other for the rest of the night. By then, my roommates and I had decided to call it a night, so we sent everybody on their merry ways. I think everybody needed to sleep it off.","Two of my roommates almost got into a fight, but we managed to make it work.

3MRNMEIQW6SMEOLL4I93EIBXK52LDR,"Two months ago I was surprised to receive an offer of employment from my former organization. It was unexpected but I thought this reflected well on my past performance as an employee. It appears that the organization is going through a restructure and my former employer thought my input and guidance would be useful during this challenging period. My former manager, who asked me to return as manager of a newly forming team, said he believed I would be a great asset in bringing old and new employees together to help drive the organization forward. He also said my old team had been affected by my retirement and their productivity was not quite as good as it had been under my leadership. Admittedly, I do miss my former colleagues and team but I do not miss the pressure of my former position and having new and harder targets to achieve on a regular basis - not only was it hard for me but even harder leading others to achieve. My former industry is becoming more and more competitive as new technologies are released and more talented people are attracted into the area. My former manager also offered me a significant pay rise and good bonus potential. I was very tempted by this offer especially as my 401k and social security could use the boost! That said there are many aspects of the job I don't want to repeat even with the temptation of potentially new ways of doing things. I was happy to retire as I was getting very tired and stressed by the demands of the organization and industry. I do not think I have the energy and ambition to tackle the more unpleasant aspects of the job. Still, the offer had me torn and I asked for a week to think things over. My former manager said that would be fine and he hoped I would return. During that week I called some former colleagues to find out what had been going on within the organization since I had retired. They all agreed, separately, that the industry has indeed become much more competitive and the organization was struggling to keep up, hence the restructure. Most commented that it had been and still was a difficult and stressful time. Some said they envied my retirement and wished they could do the same! The things my colleagues said helped me make up my mind to turn down the offer. I enjoy being retired too much to return to a highly stressful job. I love being able to spend much more time with my grandchildren and money isn't too tight. I don't have expensive tastes any way. I also enjoy spending time on my hobbies and not having to get up every morning at the same time.","After Retirement .

His car was in the shop getting fixed and of course I agreed.  The gym is a short distance away and I've been in a position where I didn't have access to my own vehicle before, so I know the feeling.  I had just dropped him off and was headed out to take care of some errands.  As I crossed through an intersection, I heard the screech of tires and caught sight of a vehicle skidding through the red light and into my passenger door.  I composed myself quickly and we both pulled over to assess the damage.  To no one's surprise, a young woman whose phone was glued to her hand had caused the accident.  I was not happy about the time and expense this was going to cause me, but the girl was as helpful as she could be.  It was refreshing to hear her agree that she was 100% at fault.  Her father also had premium insurance, so everything would be taken care of.  As I made a previously-unexpected trip to the body shop, I thought about how the day had started helping my own brother out because of his lack of transportation.

Yeah, right before my student teaching internship. I was so, so excited to finally be in a classroom for almost real, to actually interact with students and have them look at me as a teacher. I had so many ideas to put into action. It feels like my future is gone in a wink. I mean, I knew this was coming. The budget hasn't been adding up for months now. Years, if I'm honest. And when I didn't get that last scholarship I knew it was over. It's just so impossibly hard now that it's actually the day. It's actually, truly over. Everything I worked for evaporated. Just for dumb reasons too, like my stupid car breaking down at the wrong time, and Rory getting sick...as if things weren't bad enough. At least I had teaching. At least I had my career. Not anymore. I don't know what I'm going to do now. My dad said he could find me a job where he works, but it'll be something awful like a secretary or IT support...not what I wanted. Not even close.

The most memorable part of my visit was seeing Times Square. If I'm being honest, the statue of liberty was surprising. I had no idea it was that beautiful. It was one of the most beautiful scenery I've ever seen. But back to the training. It was a really cool experience. This new operating system is like nothing I've ever seen. The projection value of this operating system could change my life. Using the new capabilities of this system, the company I work for can make millions if not billions and you know what that means for me. I might become a millionaire.

They act on the outside like it's about church and religion, but it's really more like regular camp and a few hours in the morning focus on religion. The rest is like regular camp. So it's really like just hanging out with your friends from school and church. It's a big hookup time during the summer. Sort of more than school time because not as many classes and studies getting in the way. Brian and Lila got together and broke up at least 3 times over the summer. Kyle must have hooked up with no less than 5 girls during that time. He's like everyone's first. He's great, but someone to never get a crush on, he's so not sticking around.

Growing up in Ames, Iowa, there wasnt a lot of career paths for me. I went to college locally and got an engineering degree, but was expected to go into agriculture. My whole family is farmers and manual work, so getting a fancy degree always had some sneers and jeers. I started working, predictably, at a farming co-op designing feed bags, but wasnt something I was really passionate about. Then about 4 months ago I got an offer from a company I applied with quite some time before. They wanted to call me and do a phone interview and I quickly agreed. They were looking for someone to test concrete density and wear and tear at the higher altitudes to see if they could make better roads up in the mountains. They were impressed with the initial call and offered to fly me out in person. I wasn't going to say no to a free vacation so i got on a plane and went to the meeting. The project lead was so impressed with the interview that he tentatively offered me a job on the spot. I still had to clear HR, but that went over smoothly. A few weeks later I got a relocation bonus check contingent on me starting and staying with the company for a year. I packed up most of my things in a Uhual and drove out to Colorado.

He was always good to me growing up, so I didn't think it would be that bad. When we first moved in, it was hard for him to adjust. He was very stressed out about it all the time, being used to just him in the house alone all the time. We had a few fights about who does the dishes and who does laundry when, but those were just hiccups in our story here. My daughter did, however, step on my father's cat, and that was hard to get over. The cat was fine, but he is my Dad's best friend, so it was tough. He yelled at my daughter -- moreso because he was afraid for the cat, but it still shocked her and me. Since then, we have all adjusted pretty well and realized that everything is going to go well.

In my last entry, I told you I was planning a surprise birthday party for Alana, my girlfriend. Well, let me tell you, she was definitely surprised. I planned her party at the orphanage, where she spent a majority of the last year volunteering and reading to the children. These kids, oh my gosh, the bond Alana has with them is amazing! I knew the Alana, along with the kids would love celebrating her birthday there. So, the morning of Alana's birthday, I sent her to the salon for a morning spa date with her best friend. I needed her distracted if I was going to be able to pull this off. After Alana's friend Bri confirmed that Alana was preoccupied, I headed to the orphanage with the best decorations and party favors my dollar store budget could afford to decorate the tiny little room that the 10 children shared. They joyously prepped the room, eager for Miss Alana to see their work. Little did any of them know, I had my own surprise up my sleeve. Not only were we going to surprise Alana for her birthday, I was finally going to get down on one knee and ask that beautiful woman to be my wife. A few hours had passed, and Bri finally texted me that they were en route. I could feel my nerves building. In just a matter of minutes, Alana would walk through that door, and my life would chage forever. We turned the lights off and waited for Alana and Bri to appear in the door way. The moment that I had been waiting for was finally here. The girls were greeted with a roaring ""SURPIRSE!"" as soon as the door opened. I was standing there, sweating more than I think I ever have! I'm not sure exactly what I said to her, I know I fumbled and stuttered through an ""I love you more than anything else,"" and I might have even shed a tear. All I know is that when that moment came, I got down on one knee and finally asked the question that I have wanted to ask since I laid eyes on her, ""Will you marry me, Alana Moser?""

When I got older and started working I added money from my paycheck that I didn't need to use at the time. The money was a lifesaver after I got married and had some kids. Sometimes when I don't have enough money in pay check from work I used my savings money to pay for bills. Fortunately, for the most part my job is stable enough that I was able rely on that money in order to pay for necessities in life. I also loved using that money for anything that my kids needed. It always felt so great to be able to use some extra money for the kids that didn't come out of my regular money and wouldn't affect my budget too much. The biggest reward of the whole thing, of course, was to see their smiling faces when I gave them a wonderful present that they had been so hopeful for. Then, three months ago, tragedy struck! For some odd reason my husband decided that he needed that money more than me and the kids. He just took half of the money out of my savings account without telling me or giving me any sort of reason! He's been completely evasive about the whole situation since it's happened and has never given me any sort of reasoning for doing that. It's upset me tremendously since I've lost so much money that I worked so hard to collect. Worse than that is that I can't buy my kids all of the things that they want and they completely deserve which depresses me since now I don't get to see their faces light up with joy when I do give them a present. Fortunately I am still working and generally money itself is not too much of a problem but this whole situation has been a giant drain on me and my life. It's just very frustrating and upsetting to think that someone who supposedly loved me so much and was raising our kids would just do this to us. I think about putting more money towards my savings account so I can rebuild what I had but then I'm not sure if I would have enough money to cover the regular bills and other daily necessities.

Maybe this is why so many of us put off— or avoid— meeting our metamours. Yet, there is something irreplaceable about making the space to get to know those connected to who we’ve been building a relationship with. Not only do we have at least one entire person in common with our metamours, but we also have personalities, cultures, and preferences that might not be met elsewhere. I was a bit hesitant about building a relationship with my polygamous partner, but as I read some articles such as the one posted above, I slowly drew into the idea that it might not be so bad after all.  Thus, a month ago, my partner introduced me to his other partner (his girlfriend). We had a short pleasant chat for a few hours and then went about our daily business. During that month again, my partner's other girlfriend reached out to me that she wanted all the 3 of us to go to a quiet cafe during the night and have a discussion with each other so we could get to know more about ourselves. I told my partner and he agreed. Thus 2 weeks ago, the 3 of us went to a cafe named the raising rabbit. The cafe was pleasantly beautiful and a bit empty, so we had a lot of time for ourselves. The menu they had was also great. We had a great chat and got to know exactly what each other liked and wanted in the relationship, how we should behave around each other, e.t.c.

I couldnt figure out where the leak was coming from right away, but as the next storm came I started to hear dripping. I trace the dripping to the window where my AC unit plugged in.

We've had season passes sense I can remember, but I've just gotten to the point where I will join her on the big rollercoasters she loves riding so much. There's the Scorpion, the Sizzler, and the Green Monster. That one is her favorite. We'd done all of the little kid stuff that I usually drag her to, and I could tell her energy was flagging. She'd been going through chemo for sometime, and I'm surprised she was able to take the hot Texas heat as long as she did. We would need to go home soon, where she'd fall asleep almost immediately upon sitting down on the couch. But first, we had to do the Green Monster. We waited in the snaking line, her resting against the guard rails along the way. When we finally got to the front, we sat in the very first row. She reminded me how rarely that happens. Immediately after the coaster took off, it began the slow ""click-click-click"" up the first hill, heading toward the first perilous drop. As we neared the top, someone tapped Mom's shoulder. She turned around and a little boy was behind her with his big brother (or so it seemed). ""Ma'am, you should take your hat off for this.""Mom faltered. She hated showing her bare head, bald from the chemo treatments. But reluctantly, she plucked it off and sat on top of it. She looked at me and gave my hand a squeeze.

Every time I'm on the subway I find myself looking around constantly, scanning everyone else up and down. I'm even thinking about what I should do if someone starts approaching me, where can I run to, where is the nearest exit, or is there anything I can just hide behind. Every now and then I see someone who looks like the mugger. It startles me every time. Even if its in broad daylight or in some big store with dozens of other people in it. I know this is insane but I think he may be following me, maybe lying in wait to do it all over again. And this I really hate, I used to have no problem with chatting up people in public, no problem with making new friends, but now I try to avoid it all costs. I just walk around with a hoodie up and headphones in, hoping no one notices me or walks towards me or anything like that.  I'm pretty much running when in public just so some other mugger will have less of a chance to exploit me. I haven't worn what I was wearing that night again. Not even the shoes. I should probably just throw all that clothing away, even seeing it sitting in the corner of the room is too much. It just brings up those memories all over that run and run like a video stuck on repeat. I'm not sure if I should donate it to goodwill or something - I don't know why I find myself thinking like this, but it's almost like everything to do with that night is tainted. Why should I give something that's been ruined like that to someone in need? I'm actually thinking of moving out of the city now. If something like this happens again I just couldn't handle it.

It was the first time I was on my own, really on my own and I had to make friends and interact with a lot of people which makes me nervous. I've always wanted to just do my own thing while in school, I never liked doing group projects or having to get up and make a speech. In college, all of these issues I have in school, I would have to be doing in order to pass my classes and in order to graduate.

Being one with nature, enjoying the cool breeze and hiking around wherever we end up. I spent about an hour driving to the camp site, even the drive was fun. I was happy at this point and looked forward to the camp to come. I arrived and set up my tent, this was really difficult and I was already getting frustrated. I could tell that I might not enjoy this after all. I looked to the left and saw a mouse. The mouse was odd looking, I wasn't sure what was wrong with it but I was a little creeped out. It started circling me and I was really regretting doing any of this. I wanted to just leave, but the mouse had me trapped! I threw a rock at it and grabbed all my things and ran back to the car.

I was feeling good after a long run along the Santa Monica coastal path, and hour of yoga, and a nice Acai bowl before bed. It was a normal weekday, living off the interest of my well-invested exit cash from Snap's IPO, wondering which canyon I'd explore north of the Palisades. Altruistic good nature ebbed into my gathering self awareness, and I was compelled to do something good for someone else. I asked Siri, ""where can I donate blood?."" A list of blood drives popped up, and I was happy to see there was one right up the street. I popped up out of bed, threw on my huaraches, pancho, and skinny jeans and hopped on my one wheel for the quick jaunt. I had never donated before, but I take good care of myself, so I wasn't surprised I passed the screening. Needles are scary, but I sucked it up for the good I was doing and this little deposit in the karma bank. I stood up to walk away, threw a shaka at the phlebotomist, and started one wheeling it home. Suddenly I lost consciousness and fell into the curb. I came to in a hospital bed, concussed, and with a broken arm. The doctor suggested I have an MRI. I don't feel good about cosmic rays penetrating my body! A bone was protruding through my skin. There was blood everywhere.","In June, I decided to donate blood at a local drive.

My birthday took place on the day my mom wanted me and my husband to go with her to do an Escape Room. It was challenging, and exhausting, but we made some pretty substantial progress. There were so many different mechanisms involved that it was hard to imagine there was actually a way out. But I was excited, and I could tell my family was excited too. We had worked hard to make progress, and while it was slow, it was still progress. It was my first ever try at one of these rooms.

Sarah was so messy, she would make food and eat it on the couch with no napkin or tray, so of course crumbs would get everywhere. It wouldn't have made me so mad had she at least vacuumed afterwards but no, she made no effort to clean. This is on top of coming home from work every night to seeing John's laundry strewn about the apartment, piled in the halls and filthy. I tried to communicate to them, I really did.. We held apartment meetings, created chore lists; they would agree to start picking up after themselves, and to their credit they would.....for a week! Then it was right back to being filthy, dirty, nasty, messy all over again! Now, I'm not a clean freak but come on... live like humans, not animals! Last month they where both late on rent by a whole 2 weeks, I was able to cover it and told them they had to pay me back by the 14th. Well, the 14th came and I asked again for the rent money, I was told to stop bugging them about it and they'd get it...Apparently John didn't stop off at the bank after work.... Yea? Right! I couldn't take it anymore. I just said, ""OK, that's fine."" My name was thankfully NOT on the lease, it was in Sarah's as she had better credit, so I didn't have to worry about breaking contract.

But I'm happy now, I'm not as stressed, I don't have a huge mess to clean up everyday and although I'm in debt from having to use my credit cards to help me through this first month, I'd rather be in debt because of my actions, not because my room mates/""""friends"" didn't help pay bills.

The sort of day where the sky is a brilliant blue and the sun is just shinning down and it feels like there's absolutely no way anything could possibly go wrong. Well, to my shock things did go quite wrong. As we drove through the swamp land, me being careful to stay on the well marked roads because I wanted to make sure to keep my daughter safe I found that the roads were actually torn apart. Since I hadn't realized this in a timely fashion I ended up flipping the car off of the side of the road into the mud.

After some extensive research I learned that the company had been pumping the swamps the last few days but had neglected to put up any sort of caution signs or do the required testing. This lack of signage is what directly lead to our accident and did not allow road users to be properly aware of a very important ongoing situation. I immediately notified my state's authorities of the issues that were going on with the company in the hopes that they would be able to help prevent something similiar happening to someone else.

They had a big party to celebrate that a great comma had been watching us with a project that the company would benefit greatly. Everyone was very happy and I could only see Teresa from human resources. She had taken A holiday in southern Greece and really looked more beautiful than normal. I wondered if she is admiring her beauty or was admiring the fact that she looked so relaxed and fresh and at that time I asked her to tell me about her vacation when that moment a companion arrived and fell and the champagne that he brought in the cup went to give the beautiful dress that the young woman brought. Immediately went to clean and I continued admiring its beauty in the distance. The next day some friends arrived with a money problem that to be honest do not understand something about bowling and I really ignored them, all the time I spent thinking about Teresa and her beautiful wine-colored dress. The truth is that I spent the next day thinking about her, what she would be doing where she was going and every time she had a chance. I talked to her but one day. unfortunately, she left work. got a better job offer and without hesitation she left. So now I only think if I will see her again one day. I hope it's like that.

I was supposed to just be there to observe and maybe pick up some ideas for the group. However, I got sucked into a major presentation! I couldn't believe it. On the second day I ran into Bob from the 8th grade team. He mentioned that their main speaker had caught the measles and was under quarantine and asked would I please step in since he new I have a masters in science education. Well, I was pretty surprised. First of all, I didn't even realize Bob was at the conference - I thought it was just the grade level leads. Secondly, I had no idea what their presentation proposal had been. But, Bob looked pretty upset so I figured I'd give it a shot. I mean, show I'm a team player and all that. Well, then I found out that the presentation was at 4pm that afternoon. Talk about no time to prepare! So I'm madly checking out their presentation outline, their slides, and their purpose and thinking ""I can't believe this."" I basically gave up a whole day of the conference in order to save Bob's rear. I sure hoped it wouldn't be as bad as I thought.

I work a good ten to twelve shifts and never missed a day or have ever been late. It is hard work but I have always made decent money.

3180JW2OT5YLFLISMRF70RAET4HJ5Z,"About five months ago I decided to go to a psychologist. I wasn't really having any problems. I just thought it would be interesting to talk to a professional about some things I've wondered about during my lifetime. Money and time were not restricting me from going, and I knew if I didn't like it after the first visit I could just stop going. But as it turned out, I really liked the therapist and enjoyed talking to her. So I went back week after week and looked forward to it. We talked about all kinds of things, but the main issue I wanted to address was why I was never interested in having a boyfriend. In high school my friends always were excited about dating. Sometimes they would be ecstatically happy about their boyfriend and another time they would be terribly depressed about a break-up. At parties you would see couples pairing off and making out. Many times 'he kissed me' would be the main topic of conversation with my friends. But I never quite understood what the attraction was. I didn't have any desire for a boyfriend. I didn't even think sex sounded interesting or desirable. And still, to this day, I have not been interested in dating. I enjoy people. I love people. But I don't have an interest in finding 'love' like you see in the movies. Well, I was surprised and, I guess, even relieved when the therapist diagnosed me as 'asexual'. Maybe I shouldn't describe it as a diagnosis because it's not a disease. There is not anything 'wrong' with me. In fact, I'm kind of glad to be asexual.

I hadn't seen him in over 30 years I was excited but worried, the only thing I was worried about is if we still would have the same chemistry we once did. At the end of the month we met up at a fast food restaurant. Once we met up again it was like old times and I realized that chemistry can't really die. It had been thirty years since we last talked but, it felt like we hadn't talked for a few days instead. We talked about old times, all the things we did in high school all the trouble we had gotten into when we were younger. We discussed old friends and old loves we had. We discussed our families and anyone we were still in contact with. I learned that he had married one of our old friends from high school and we actually made plans to have dinner at his house so that I can meet their kids and see his wife again. Its crazy to think his youngest kid of 4 children is a senior in high school. I feel like it was only a couple years ago that we were having house parties and running from the cops. Of course, that's years ago now at this point. I found out that he had a few dark years after high school, he told me the trouble he got into. He spent a few years in jail for burglary, but said those days are long behind him. We are both old now. We kind of realized simultaneously at the restaurant how two punk kids whose parents and teachers told them they were going to be nothing ended up having pretty nice lives. Also, it didn't matter anyway all the people who had their sour opinions about us are dead at this point anyway. We talked for a few more hours, before we realized that it had been a few hours.

I was sitting home alone relaxing when I get a frantic phone call from my sister in law who lives around the block. She said she feels some pain and thinks she might be having the baby. She was 38 weeks pregnant, so I figured it was just Braxton Hicks contractions, but I headed over to her house anyway. Once I got there and saw the puddle of liquid on the floor around her I knew she was having the baby. She didn't want to call an ambulance because they would take her to the closest hospital, not the one she wanted to go to. I had no choice but to drive her. This was her third child and the doctors had predicted that once she went into labor she would deliver very quickly, so I was terrified she was going to deliver my niece in my car. The 45 minute drive to the hospital was the most nerve wracking experience of my life. I can't even explain how much I was shaking and praying. I was praying we made it, I was praying I wouldn't have to deliver a baby on the side of the road. For as much as I was freaking out my sister in law was surprisingly calm. She focused on her breathing and didn't talk much. I could tell as we approached the hospital that the pain was starting to be too much for her. I pulled up outside of the hospital and she jumped out and ran into the emergency room. I parked the car and ran inside after her. They took her into the delivery room right away and luckily my brother was able to make it to the hospital before the baby was born.

It really seems to give me energy through the day, and is the best workout imaginable at that time in the morning. My stamina has also increased nearly three times over, and I can run for a few miles easily without even feeling winded. About a month ago I went for a super long run back to my old hometown. It was still before sunrise and the town was eerily silent. I kept going towards an old elementary school that I attended as a kid. I'm not sure what came over me but I opted to stop running immediately noticed a massive tree I remember from school. We often used to climb this same tree during recess, and it brought positive memories to once again be in its presence. A tree that I took for granted at the time was standing before me, looking the same as always. I sat down under it and really started to think about life and how time passes us by. I felt a great deal of peace for the twenty odd minutes I sat down pondering. Then as I began to see the sun begin to wake, I gave one final stretch and look over my surroundings.  I felt strangely at peace with everything in life, filled with nostalgia even. I then hopped to my feet and began my long run back home as the sun escaped from the horizon.",I left on a morning run to find myself at a school I once attended.

37UEWGM5HUU3PR0MT9M4ZSJN2OX1RT,"I met Emily three years ago on spring break. We happened to be on the same boat for a Niagara Falls tour and she had forgotten to bring a poncho.  I was standing beside her when the mist started hitting us and she was shivering. I offered her my poncho and we started talking.  It turned out that we were both students at NYU.  She was a freshman with her eyes on law school and I was getting ready to graduate with a business degree and begin working towards my MBA. Back at school, our lives were busy, but we made time to see each other, even if it meant just sitting together to study in the library.  As we got to know each other, I realized that Emily was someone I wanted to be with forever.  After completing my master's, I was able to start saving for a ring.  Six weeks ago, exactly 3 years after we met, I suggested that we make a trip back to Niagara Falls. I placed the ring in the pocket of her yellow poncho.  When she put the poncho on, she pulled out the box and I got to one knee.  I was worried for a moment as she gazed at me without saying anything, a thoughtful look in her eyes.  She seemed to snap out of her trance and said yes.  Everyone on the boat clapped and we got many congratulations as we exited after the tour. I was still concerned about her hesitancy, though. I thought we were perfectly happy and I was confident she wanted to marry me. I asked her a few days later if everything was ok. I noticed that she would occasionally glance at the ring on her finger with a sort of sad look in her eyes.  She said that she was concerned about law school. She had applied to a few schools, some which were several hours drive away. She wanted to marry me, but was afraid that being so far apart for that long would be difficult and that our relationship might suffer.  She was torn between possibly pursuing a different career so that we could go ahead and marry or having to wait through three difficult years apart. Then yesterday, Emily got what she was hoping for -- what we were both hoping for -- her acceptance letter to NYU's law school! It was such a relief to know that we could be together while she completed her law degree.","I proposed to my long time girlfriend. I did it at Niagara falls, her favorite spot.

We ate breakfast then loaded up the truck with the kayaks and drove out to the dock.  After parking and getting set up we were ready to go out on the river.  We had coolers filled with drinks and sandwiches, fruit and snacks. My brother's girlfriend started drinking as soon as she woke up, and didn't eat breakfast so the drinks started hitting her hard before we were even out on the water.  As we started kayaking I was having fun, but it was apparent that my brother's girlfriend was drinking too much and was going to have some issues.   She immediately lost her paddle and we had to hurry to grab it for her. She thought it was funny, well she thought everything was funny thanks to the influence of alcohol, and while she started laughing and having fun, my brother and I were in damage control mode, having to watch her and make sure that she was ok. I wasn't able to have a good time because everytime we got into a rhythm on the water, she would flip her kayak and we'd have to stop and fix everything again.  I was getting really frustrated, if she hadn't drank so much then we could be having an enjoyable time. I think next time my brother asks me to go kayaking with him I'm going to specify that it should only be me and him, that way I can have fun without worrying about another person.  I really wanted to have a good time today, I'm miffed that I wasn't able to because of one person.  Maybe if she would've ate breakfast it wouldn't have been so bad. I'm going to have a talk with my brother about this, maybe he can tell her how uncool her actions were.

When I went to check out my fears came to fruition when my discounts and free items were all rang in full price.  I told the clerk about the deals in the ad and they had no idea what I was talking about.  They took a long time to ask another person, who also did not know.  Then they walked all the way to where I got the product only to find there was nothing there either, which I tried to tell them.  Then I went to the front of the store and got the ad to show them.  This prompted them to ask a senior member of the staff who quickly said yes of course give them the discount.  This added so much time to a trip that was supposed to be quick.  Not to mention I was in the checkout line for a long time because the worker was kind of slow.  Once I got home tried to make up time by prepping the food as fast as I could.  But in the end everything food wise was delayed because I got everything in the slow cooker and in the marinade that much later.  I also was unable to do a couple of things like check email or make a music playlist for the rest of the days errands.  I hate feeling rushed, it stresses out my whole day and I end up doing things worse than if I was relaxed.",I had a bad customer service. I was at a local grocery store.

33IZTU6J82NNG7LSFR7GKBSKJCESXN,"About two months ago, I began to be worried about my cat, Fluffy. He has been my pet for almost 13 years now and has always been a great companion. He is always waiting for me at the door when I come home from work, he loves to brush up against me and show affection, and he has the sweetest meow. When I first adopted Fluffy, he was already missing one eye, but it never really seemed to bother him. He got around about as well as I expect any cat would, and his disability didn't seem to bother him. I loved him all the same. However, one day I noticed that he seemed to have trouble navigating around; he was more cautious, wasn't as accurate in his jumping abilities, and occasionally would run into an object. I didn't notice anything obviously physically wrong with him, but I decided to take him to the vet to see what was going on. The vet gave me some bad news: Fluffy's vision in his one remaining eye was deteriorating and the cause was ocular cancer. The doc gave me two options -- we could remove Fluffy's remaining eye to prevent the spread of the cancer, or we could do nothing but monitor the situation. In the first case, Fluffy would be totally blind, but in the second, he may only have several months to a year before the cancer spread and took his life. I was devastated and told the vet I would have to think about it. He said he would respect whatever decision I made, but if we were to operate, it should be done as soon as possible. I went home and thought long and hard about the decision. I didn't want to take away Fluffy's one remaining eye and plunge him into a world of sightlessness, but I also couldn't stand the thought of losing my wonderful companion of so many years. In the end, I couldn't deprive my cat of such a vital sense as his sight. Although it may prolong his life, it seemed more like a selfish demand on my part. The vet said he likely wouldn't suffer much, and that we would check up on him frequently to see if he was in any pain. If the time came when he was suffering, I would try to do right by my furry friend and ensure his passing was painless. It has been two months since I made my decision, and I still question whether I'm doing the right thing. I try to spend as much quality time as I can with Fluffy and enjoy him without thinking about the inevitable future. Time is so precious to us living things, and it must run out some day, but in the meantime Fluffy is still the cat he always was -- if a bit slower -- and so far his cancer hasn't spread. I hope that our time together is as long as possible. I will always treasure him being in my life.","My cat has only one eye and is losing his vision to ocular cancer.

One was to force blindness on him, second is to take a chance that the cancer will not spread. Both the options were very difficult and painful for me. I was not in a situation like this before.

To have someone interrupt your life so abruptly is devastating to say the least.  They've returned with more people than when they left us.  We now have 6 grandchildren, which they're not biologically mine.  We have come adjusted to living alone for so many years.  As we transition into being senior citizens, this hasn't been easy at this time in our lives.  But, if I could alter all of the event, I don't think I would because some things happen for a reason.  We all may need each other in the future so  being in close contact might make things easier.

I had recently gotten a significant promotion at work and we knew that with the economy being the way it was, it was as good a time as ever to make this move. Whenever we talked about our wishes for our future home, we always knew we wanted a view. There was some land being prepared for some new houses to be built on in our current neighborhood. The way it was set up, we knew that there would never be the ability to have new construction block the view of the lot we wanted to purchase, meaning we would always have the view we wanted. With the market being the way it is, our house sold quickly and we needed to move into temporary residence until the new home construction was completed. We chose to rent a duplex in our current neighborhood so that the kids school would not be affected. This was going to be an exciting adventure for them! We had secured all the loans and funding in addition to the money from the sale of our house to purchase the new home and were all set to get going on the build. There ended up being a very bad weather pattern that settled in our area for weeks.

There were even some who showed up who didn't even RSVP, which was great, because we were sort of sad that my kid's friends wouldn't all be there to celebrate with him. My wife had bought WAY too many presents, naturally. I spent the day setting up all the tents outside, so we would have room for everyone. It was supposed to rain that day, but we lucked out and it turned out really nice. My son had a blast with all his friends at his house. He was very excited to show them all his toys and we really didn't have any conflicts over them, which is rare. It was so hard to tear him away from his friends to actually sit down and participate in his own party! In the end, his friends were the ones to actually convince him to come and eat cake. He loves chocolate cake a lot too. We had one made with some characters from a TV show he likes, which was a great surprise for him. He tore into his cake too, really enjoyed it and made a mess everywhere which was ok, since we were outside. The dogs had a good time cleaning up the cake and ice cream afterwards too. Naturally, all his buddies were excited to have him open their presents, and I think he even had more fun opening the presents, moreso than what they actually contained. In the end, it was a really great day and we all had a blast together.",My son had his first birthday. He made a mess eating chocolate cake and then he opened gifts.

Right now I am working on building chicken coops so we can get hens for eggs and I am planning on placing ducks in the pond out back so I can get duck eggs.  We plan on raising our own eggs and beef cattle so we can avoid paying high prices for groceries.  Everything is good despite a tragedy that occurred on the farm two weeks earlier in the pigpen.  My sister went out to the pigpen one night to feed the pigs.  I woke up in the morning and she was nowhere to be found. I went to the pigpen and found nothing but bones and a few teeth.  The pigs had eaten my sister.  I didn't want to deal with the police so I buried her bones in the meadow and had a memorial. This gave me an idea. I was tired of my wife running around and cheating on me with every man in town and I thought about killing her for awhile but I was worried about getting caught. If I killed her and fed her to the pigs they would eat her, bones and all and the police would never find out what happened to her.

About four weeks ago I went to a Bad Religion concert; that is where I discovered this feeling. In the space of just five hours I experienced things that I think people take lifetimes to discover. I made friends and I danced with perfect strangers. I experienced an emotional roller-coaster moving swiftly from excitement, nervousness, frustration, delight, and finally into pure unadulterated ecstasy. I even got to meet the band! The guys were amazing, I felt like an old friend visiting them. I really expected the meet and greet to suck, they'd be tired from performing and just want us gone. It wasn't like that at all! For a moment I thought one of them was going to invite me to an after party but when someone yawned the moment was gone.

At first I thought it was just stress or lack of sleep but the odd feelings didn't subside and I decided that I needed to make an appointment with the doctor. The process of making an appointment was easy enough, but as the date was upon me I began to become very nervous about what they were going to discover was wrong with me. Could it be cancer? Diabetes? Do I have a family history of these kind of illnesses? Perhaps I should call my mother to get some reassurance? I decided against the latter and dressed myself for the occasion of wondering out to meet my fate. When I arrived at the doctor's office they started off with some simple blood tests and then ended up booking me for an extended EEG. I wasn't exactly sure what that meant, but the doctor said that it was a test to find out if my brain was functioning as intended. It turned out that my scan was abnormal and they did a bunch more tests without giving me any concrete answers as to what was wrong with me. The whole ordeal was very stressful and by the time it was over all I wanted to do was go home and sleep. Even after all the tests were done they said they couldn't tell me exactly what was causing the abnormal brain patterns, but that they would study the results and try to have some answers within the next few weeks. So, now I'm sitting here and trying to distract myself from the fact that my brain is broadcasting abnormal messages and there may be something seriously wrong with how my head is working.

I was very stressed out but so happy that my friend Belle was there to support me and even though my head still ached from time to time I was able to finally sleep that night.

3RXCAC0YISBUB1BTCJ17FYSODW68GN,"When I joined the military as a teenager I only planned on serving one enlistment of four years. Twenty years later I am now sitting here wondering where the time has gone as I am in the process of retiring and beginning that next chapter of my life. I stayed in for many reasons but one of the biggest reasons were the promotions and opportunities afforded to me. Prior to the military most job positions I had lacked any ability to be promoted or opportunities for advancement. For those that had them the qualifications were vague, subjective, or I did not qualify due to things such as a college degree being required. In the military I found that everything was written so that things were defined and understood. Everyone had the ability to be promoted it was a question of if you wanted to be. What very few understood, though, was that you could go above and beyond just being promoted with the norm but hard work and knowledge of your job could be recognized by superiors with advanced promotion. This happened to me multiple times. When I went through the nursing program, on my last week of school, I had to study both for the nursing exam as well as my promotion exam. I was in the top 5% of the nursing class and I was the only individual to get a perfect score on the promotion board. I was promoted 2 years earlier than I was eligible to recognize me for my hard work. One year later I was promoted again one year earlier than I was eligible which, combined, pushed my rank 3 years ahead of fellow peers. This went on for my entire career. The hard work I put in went towards early promotions allowing me to achieve rank higher than peers. This led to higher pay raises and more income earned over time. It allowed me to attend education and training opportunities I would not of been able to otherwise. This allowed me to be able to afford materialist goods I desired and to pay for the family I currently share my life with each day. The promotions and income allowed us to have nicer homes, nicer cars, and more time off to spend with one another. Many complain that promotions, wealth, and education are all based on who you know and luck. I came from a household of poverty and am now considered upper middle class retired before age 40 with a masters in nursing. I am proof that hard work leads to those promotions and success in life. I made my own “luck.”",Working hard at my job eventually led to a promotion.  My life has greatly increased since achieving this goal.,90.0

On this particular weekend, I showed up to the house and I already knew something was off. I smelled smoke. We had agreed that while around the kids, my ex was not supposed to ever smoke cigarettes. He had even told me that he quit. When I opened the front door, already furious, I found my ex smoking a cigarette on the couch. My children were nowhere to be found on the first floor. I yelled at him and asked him what he was doing. He said that he was sorry and that he had a really rough day. A rough day does not allow him to smoke a cigarette in the house when my kids are around. We even have in writing in legal documents that he is not allowed to smoke around them. I called the police and they showed up around five minutes later and diffused the situation. My husband had to agree that if he smokes again he will not be allowed to watch my children. It was a good life lesson for my children because they learned that smoking is not good for them and that they should not be around second-hand smoke.

When I let him out, he climbed right over the fence.  He was just a little kitten, so I didn't think he'd be able to do that.  He just jumped right over it as though he was a full-grown cat.

And it got louder and louder, to the point where it seemed to fill the air around us completely. Of course everyone in the park started looking around to see where the noise came from. And it became quickly obvious that it came from the sky. Six jets, clearly war planes of some kind, flew over us, almost as fast as arrows. They were flying in V formation like geese - dark, deadly, shrieking metal geese. They flew toward the river, and beyond, leaving everybody shaken, overwhelmed and very surprised.

We headed out right before sunrise and by 10 o'clock we were pulling into the parking lot at the beach. For as long as I can remember, I've loved the water. I grew up near the ocean and have always loved to surf and body board. My girlfriend, on the other hand, was much more of a sunbathing type, so usually I would be out in the water on my own. On this particular morning, it was early in the season, so the beach was relatively uncrowded. The waves weren't quite big enough to be worth surfing, so I decided that I would just enjoy the water and possibly catch a few waves body surfing. I dived out into the water, ducking under waves, until finally I got past the point where the waves were breaking. I love to swim beyond the waves because it is so peaceful out there. You can watch the waves break on to the shore and the people on the beach, all while relaxing in the water, surrounded by the peaceful ocean. I was floating on my back for awhile, deep in peaceful thought, when all of a sudden a felt something bump against the bottom of my leg. I was immediately startled, but I am very comfortable in the ocean, so I quickly dismissed it as a piece of debris or clump of seaweed and went back to floating on my back. Just as I started to relax again, I saw what appeared to be a fin surface for just a moment about 8 feet to my left. Once again, due to my experience, I tried to be rational and tell myself that it was most likely a dolphin. Still, I was uncomfortable and started to carefully make my way back to shore. Just as a I passed back over the wave line, I saw the fin again, but this time I could also see the outline of a nearly seven foot shark attached to it. I will never forget the feeling of being that close to a predator of that size and power. All of the Shark Week specials in the world combined wouldn't have been able to prepare me for the feeling of sheer helplessness I experienced as I realized that my life was in the hands of the literal dinosaur just a few feet away from me. My mind instantly froze and instincts fought to take over. Every part of my body was telling me to swim away as fast as I could, but I knew that would only make my situation worse. I calmly moved at a slow and steady pace away from the shark and towards the shore. I decided to train my vision on my girlfriend, and told myself I wouldn't look back. After what felt like hours, I finally got back to shore and ran up to our blanket. That was enough ocean for me for one day, and after telling my girlfriend what had happened, we decided we would spend the rest of the day safe on the sand.","A great white shark swam past me while I was surfing.

3CP1TO84PUNL9PKKF69F1AOW2CL25W,"In Seven months Ago, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in women. I was felt some pain in the armpits or breast that does not change with the monthly cycle. Also pitting or redness of the skin of the breast, similar to the surface of an orange. A rash around or on one of the nipples and discharge from a nipple, possibly containing blood. So I confirmed that I was diagnosed with breast cancer. The doctor will check the breasts for lumps and other symptoms. Several tests can help detect breast cancer as Mammogram, Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The main treatment are radiation therapy, chemotherapy, surgery, biological therapy, or targeted drug therapy, hormone therapy. But  I had chemo, surgery and radiation as treatment. If surgery is necessary, the type will depend on both the diagnosis and individual preference. A lumpectomy can help prevent the spread of the cancer. This may be an option if the tumor is small and easy to separate from its surrounding tissue.  A simple mastectomy involves removing the lobules, ducts, fatty tissue, nipple, areola, and some skin. In some types, a surgeon will also remove the lymph nodes and muscle in the chest wall. A person may undergo radiation therapy around a month after surgery. Radiation involves targeting the tumor with controlled doses of radiation that kill any remaining cancer cells. A doctor may prescribe cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs to kill cancer cells if there is a high risk of recurrence or spread. When a person has chemotherapy after surgery, doctors call it adjuvant chemotherapy. Sometimes, a doctor may choose to administer chemotherapy before surgery to shrink the tumor and make its removal easier. Doctors call this neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The entire process was very exhausting and emotional draining.","I was diagnosed with breast cancer.  I had chemo, surgery and radiation as treatment.

Though we had already broken up at the time, Steve was still living at my house while he looked for a new place. It certainly made for an uncomfortable living situation. So apparently Steve lost his key and ended up pounding on the door and smashing the doorbell over and over. It startled me awake to say the least. When I opened the door I was shocked to find a bloody mess. Steve's friend was holding his hands over his face, as blood poured out onto the ground. They were hysterical and didn't even answer me at first about what the heck had happened. Evidently they had gotten into a fight in the parking lot over something trivial and my ex punched him in the face. What a good friend! It was clearly a broken nose that needed to be re-set, which was a bit above my pay grade as a trainee nurse. The house was absolutely covered in blood though, especially the bathroom where Steve's friend immediately went after coming inside.

So told her I would be supportive of any decision that she made, and that I would always be there for her if she needed me. We hugged, and she began to cry.

We sat up most of the night asking ourselves will we be good parents, will she love us, will she be happy, our minds were simply a blur.  Our alarm went off at 6 AM that morning but we were up before then having some coffee since neither of us could really eat that morning.   Once we arrived at the courthouse we sat in the car for about 15 minutes still asking ourselves are we doing the right thing, will we be able to give her the best life possible.

Thee months ago was the start of the truth but the story is even older by another four years. Our relationship was a long distance one spanning an entire ocean, time zones were a constant challenge but somehow it always worked. I was a college graduate with a Masters in Bio Engineering and se was a post grad working towards a career in medicine. We would speak twice minimum every week for at least ninety minutes and spend two weeks together twice a year, once in my hometown and once in hers. Most of the four years went on without a hitch but I could tell in the fourth things were changing a bit. Our phone calls became slightly shorter and a bit less detailed. We missed a few of our annual get togethers, we were pulling back a bit. I decided then that is was now time to make an extra effort to close that wide ocean separating us and took a dive. It took a great deal of effort and deep discussions with he in the six months leading to the wedding but still there was something off.  The wedding planning was smooth and very little went wrong.

36H9ULYP63GDHIBHS3SGM31RI5MJFN,"I went for a run this morning, and I couldn't finish.  My knee was really hurting.  There was no ignoring it this time.  I had noticed the knee pain from time to time the last few months.  I initially chalked it up to the increase in my distance running since I was prepping for a half marathon.   I was starting to worry that I had a small tear in a tendon or possibly had done some serious damage to my kneecap the last time I fell while running in the rain.  I decided that I needed to call a doctor and have it checked out.  My regular doctor was able to get me in the next day, first thing in the morning.  He instructed me not to take painkillers or do anything that might effect the actual issue I was dealing with.  Normally, the pain went away relatively quickly, but not this time.  I was DYING to use some ICY HOT, or take some Advil.  As promised, the doc saw me at 9am bright and early - I had never been so happy to see him.  He ran some tests, took some blood, wrenched my knee this way and that until it brought tears to my eyes.  He also ran an extra AND took an Ultrasound.  All this uncertainty had me extremely worried.   He said he thought I had arthritis, but really wanted me to see an orthopedic doctor to confirm.  At 33, he felt I was really awful young and healthy to be worried about arthritis.   I was shuttled to the other side of the hospital offices to meet with the ortho doc.   He did, in fact, confirm that I had Osteoarthritis in my knee.   There really is no CURE or treatment, only a way to calm the symptoms.  I felt really defeated.  I loved to run - it was my source of stress relief and made me feel so good about myself.   The doctor suggested I cut back to my old running routine, and put the half marathon on hold - apparently by giving my knee a break and boosting bone strengthening vitamin intake - my knee might bounce back later.   But in my mind,...all I could imagine was being 45 and walking with a cane.  I mean, if it is already starting at my age - I didn't like to think about what the future would hold.","I noticed knee pain and initially dismissed it.

He lives very close to a he lives in a very nice subdivision with lots of nature around him also there is a forest preserve with a walking path. I have gone down it many times and it is just a wonderful way to connect with nature I think this would be great outlet for him to release some of his stress.  After I made the suggestion to him he was very excited about what that could do for him and so it could help him saying anxiety.  When he weather permits, he typically like to take a walk or ride his bike through some trails in the woods at his house; He generally focuses on the wind and the temperatures of the breeze, the ambient noises coming from the trees, and he particularly likes the warmth of the sun and the way it shines through the trees.  One day, he was walking down the path and and saw two deer standing in the way.  One ran away the other just kind of stood there and looked at him for a short period of time.  He was startled for a few seconds and then figured he was not going to be harmed. The deer found an it apple on the side of the path, bit down on it and then took off into the woods.  He said this was a wonderful serene moment and he felt that he was very connected with nature Either way, he explained he always feel a bit more relaxed and content afterwards.  I'm glad this is a remedy for his anxiety. I'm sure that there are other opportunities in his life feel an inner sense of peace from doing this type of meditation.

San Diego always felt relatively close to where we live, but after spending long, grueling hours in a minivan with my entire family, I now know better. Writing about it this way makes the trip seem worse than it really was. Despite spending what seemed like an eternity cramped into a small space with the people who know how to get on your nerves better than anyone else, the experience was something that I'll always cherish. It's only been 5 months since we've come back and the memories of our time at Sea World are just as fresh and vivid as if we had only returned yesterday. I can still smell the different exhibits clearly. I've never been a fan of seeing animals in captivity, but I can't deny the impact of seeing an orca or dolphin up close. Even the penguin habitat took my breath away. It's hard to reconcile these feelings. My family seemed to enjoy it just as much as I did. Maybe more. They don't have the same reservations that I do about zoos and such. It was definitely something that my little brother won't ever forget. I think he's just old enough to really realize what's going on, and you could see on his face that the moment he pet the dolphin was magical.

This story begins like any other -- I started the day by waking up, showering, having a small breakfast and then preparing to leave for work. On most days, I ride to work with my coworker since he lives very close by and doesn't mind driving me. That day was no different. I hopped in my coworker's (we'll refer to him as 'D' from now on) car and said 'good morning'. D greeted me, we put our seat belts on and then headed for work. Everything seemed to be going as it normally did - D and I shared some small-talk on the way to work. We ended up stopping at a coffee-shop drive through to help us wake up a little more.   After leaving the coffee shop, our normal routine was disrupted by something rather shocking and unexpected: While we were at a stoplight, we witnessed a vehicle run a red light and hit a pedestrian who was crossing the road with his car! D and I were both shocked and felt helpless. I immediately dialed 911 to report an emergency, as I was worried for the pedestrian's life. To my surprise, after explaining the incident, the 911 operator put me on hold! I couldn't believe that an emergency this severe was being put on the back burner -- I was a little peeved. However, around 3 minutes later, the operator came back on the phone and assured me that emergency services were on their way. I was relieved, but still worried about the pedestrian who had been stuck by the car.   At this point, D and I decided to get out of the car and make sure the pedestrian was alright. The pedestrian was in disarray, but stable and not in critical danger -- he just had a few scrapes and bruises.    Around 4 minutes later, the ambulance arrived. We stayed with the pedestrian until the ambulance assured us that he was alright and taken care of.

So the day came, I went and awaited while really feeling the anxiety and the feeling of being ill were not nice at all during those long hours that I had to wait to finally get my turn with the doctor. The consultation was normal, except for the last part when the internist told me he was worried about certain findings during the physical exam and the interrogation so he asked me to go to certain laboratory and do like 3 exams, so did I. I returned to the doctor's office and he gave me the diagnosis, testicular cancer. I could not believe what was happening at the moment, I got frustasted even though all the things that the doctor was explaining to me made sense and actually explained why I was feeling like that but it is not easy to accept this kind of news right away, it is just a hard pill to swallow. However I found certain strenght in me, I asked the doctor: ""what is the next step?"". He promptly answered me he will referred me to a specialist which he will guide in the following steps, that I should not lost any hope because my cancer was at the early stages so my chances were high to survive it. I immediatly went to the specialist's office and he examined me and he started talking about my case, he was making sure that I fully understood everything he was telling during our first consultation because it was key to start the treatment process. Then he gave me the steps to follow, what kind of diet should I have, what medicine will I be taking from now on and how regularly should I be coming to follow my case. The final outcome of this initial phase was preparing me to surgery because my situation was hopeful given the early detection. I followed the instructions given me to letter by letter because in my mind I was sure that I would not give up on living and being with my family. Weeks were passing by and I was starting to feel better, even though, I had to admit when I started taking the medication it was kind of hard getting used to this meds because they are really strong nothing like the usual stuff you would be taking for a cold. The last follow-up with the specialist was decisive, he gave priority and we set up the date for the surgery. I got home and it suddenly realized how big that day would be, it would mark a difference in my life. The date was getting closer and the anxiety was getting higher however I would not give up. The date came and the surgery was performed, everything went great.

The trip to the airport was a bit lonely because my most recent trip was with an ex of mine whom I traveled with frequently. I found myself reflecting on that relationship and our struggles during transit. Along with the lonely feelings I had while making my way on this trip was a profound feeling of smallness. I felt very much just like another piece of cargo; screened, packed up, put on a conveyer, and shipped. The constant goings and comings of an airport can make one feel quite small when alone, adrift in a sea of strangers trying their best to keep their cool in the face of the complications of travel. A woman next to me in the terminal nearly had a breakdown when she learned her flight had been delayed. It was quite the scene. Though I don't often worry about the safety of air travel, it definitely occurred to me that should my plane crash(as unlikely as that was to happen) I would just be another name on a manifest of souls lost to mechanical malfunction or ill-tempered weather. It's a shitty feeling to think that you're just another face in a crowd and mass transit sure has a way of making you feel exactly that way. Ultimately I got to my destination and had a fine time. Being a tourist in another town is freeing in a way, because you're not beholden to certain local customs. You're forgiven for asking questions, being lost, meandering about in public spaces, and generally being curious when you'd otherwise be expected to be getting on with your life.",I flew in an airplane for the first time. The experience was transcending and made me realize how small I was.,7.0

At least not that I had realized. My Papaw a week ago was the first person to say that we should go see my Great Aunt Helen before she passed away. Mind you I'm twenty five now and have never even heard of the woman. Guilt must have been a motivating factor, he had vowed to pay my way and who was I to pass up the opportunity? The most stressful thing was getting through the airport and the wait to even get on the plane. I don't ever remembering having to take my shoes off to get through an x-ray machine, but I did and I didn't die from it I guess, haha. It took a bit to even get going after sitting down in my seat with my Papaw. He seemed nervous, but I was not. I wanted to mark this off of my bucket list. The take off really freaked me out, but being in that seat, man there is NOTHING like it. I felt lifted out of my body. There was a familiar knot I felt in my stomach like when I was high on a Roller Coaster, but it was only similar in that sense. Nothing and I mean NOTHING, compared to this feeling. I looked down through the window at what looked like boxes of corn fields and such and just realized that somewhere down there in those little tiny rows were my family. I was that small. I still can't get over that feeling that somewhere there are tons of people probably having that same revelation. It's an insane experience and I'm glad I got to do it.

I thought about the new levels of stress and responsibility I would have to deal with if I got the position, but I also thought about all the new projects I can be involved in and the work I can help shape. So I ultimately decided to take a chance an applied for the position. About a week after I sent in my application, I got a call from my supervisor. He told me that if I was sure about taking this position? He said he's asking because this role is known to have a high turn over rate. To be honest, I felt like he was just trying to scare me away from the job, so I told him I was serious about the job. He then said the interview for the position starts a week from that day, and I am the first one up to be interview out of a total of 15 applicants. I spent the next week practicing my answer and pitch. I made sure to remember all my accomplishments and the best way to convey them during the interview. By the day of the interview, I felt that I was ready. The interview was more intense that I expected. The questions were pointed and the complexity of the questions were high. I absolutely believe I would have bombed the interview if I didn't spend every waking moment I wasn't working or sleeping practicing my answers and my delivery.

I started to listen to his songs in college because my boyfriend and share a favorite. It was like he was signing to me except there were thousands of other people there. My boyfriend and I fought the crowd and found our seats just in time. The parking lot was jammed packed and almost made us late for the show. Anyways, once we got in our seats the lights flashed on and he came out with a guitar singing and started singing in the mic. There were a few slow songs in which people would hold up their lighters and wave them in the air. He played for a good 2 hours and even brought some special guests on stage. I was hoping we'd catch a peek after the show when he went to his tour bus. Once again the crowd was so thick we couldn't make it outside in time. The experience was overwhelming and I won't forget the pure joy I felt that day. I'm glad that I could share the moment with my hunny bunny even though I paid for the tickets.

They wanted to get married in a field, which is what they got: a small meadow in a grove of old-growth oaks.  The weather was unseasonably cool, and basically perfect: blue sky with fluffy white clouds, only about 80 degrees, and not a drop of rain.  I finally know what they mean when they say a bride looks radiant: I've never seen Jane looking so happy! The ceremony was conducted by Uncle Tad. He made some moving remarks. Afterwards, we took tractors and trams across the highway to a little ""lodge"" and retreat center.  I saw so many of our friends and family and it was great to reminisce and play ""catch up"" with them. I gave a toast that I worked on for weeks, and Jane cried a little. Dinner was excellent and we danced the night away! I also made a lot of new friends, including a college friend of my sister's. She and I really hit it off!

When I arrive at the hotel room everything seemed normal so we immediately handled our financial business. He then went into bathroom and asked me to put on a blindfold. I was a little reluctant however, since it was a referral I did it anyway. Several minutes later he comes out of the bathroom takes me by the hand and opens the adjoining door to the room next door. He takes off my blindfold and I see that the entire room is filled with at least a thousand pieces of fresh fruit. I looked over at him, and to my utter shock, he's wearing nothing but an adult size baby diaper! Not to get into too much detail but he wanted me to do unspeakable things to him with the fruit. I had to think about it for a second but like I said, the money is good and besides no one was getting hurt. About 30 minutes go by then all of a sudden, there's was a very loud knocking at the door. Since he's in the diaper, I go to answer the door. To my surprise, it was the police saying that someone had called in a domestic disturbance happening in our room. Then without hesitation, my client blurts out ""She's a prostitute and she made me do it."" So guess what? I get taken to jail and he's left to try and explain the ""situation"" to the police.","Again, sad, mad, depressed, disappointed. One night in jail and a record for life.

I can't even recall how many years ago we started talking about it, dreaming about it, and hoping it would happen. One of our biggest wishes and dreams came true, we bought our first home. For a while, and I mean a while, we had no idea what area we would be looking in. All we knew is that we didn't want to buy a home too far from our family so our son could grow up knowing them. We also wanted our parents to witness him grow in person and not over a video chat hundreds or thousands of miles away. The way it all happened was so crazy and unexpected, I didn't really see it coming. We were renting a very old, run down house that was poorly renovated to be a duplex. The walls were thin, there were leaks and holes on the outside allowing all sorts of wildlife into the attic and crawl spaces. The stairs were so narrow that getting furniture in and out had to be done out of the second floor. We had to get out of there and fast. One day I went to get my haircut and I started talking to the hairdresser that I had only seen once before. I was talking about our need to move and that we didn't want to move too far from where we were. Much to my shock she was actually considering short term renting and selling the home she lived in. I pulled into the driveway and fell in love. It was absolutely perfect. A brick home and a large fenced in yard in the perfect location. I felt like I was dreaming and knew we had to have it. I called my husband and told him I had found our dream home and we needed to make an appointment at the bank to lock in a mortgage. A week later we were sitting down with a woman at the bank, going over our finances, credit scores, and what we could offer as a down payment. We almost didn't make the cut, but they actually approved us for the mortgage loan! It was one of the happiest moments of my entire life. We had finally made it. We were now homeowners and everyone was over the moon with joy and anticipation of moving in and getting settled. I can't believe how lucky we are to own this amazing home.","The first time buying a home of our own and becoming a new homeowner.

A few days before he left I started feeling sad, knowing I would miss him. It's just the two of us, so my house would feel empty. But I was also excited to start my next life chapter. We made the drive to school a fun road trip of a few days to spend some last time together. But wow. Now that he's been gone I can't believe how much I miss him. I'm really crushed to have him gone. I feel kind of guilty about this and hide it from him when he calls or texts to check in. He does miss me, too, of course, which is natural for all kids going off to college.

I'm still amazed at what happened two weeks ago, and have to tell you about it! You know how I did that DNA test a while ago? Well I got the results back, and there was actually a cousin I never knew I had who lived just a mile away in our little senior community! From what I understand, she's a cousin on my father's side, the daughter of his sister. I guess there was some bad blood between her and her parents when she was young, and so she ran away.

It took me a few days, Diary, to get up the courage to try to contact her. Finally, I looked her up on the internet and found a number for her. I dialed, said who I was and what the DNA test had revealed, and, surprisingly, she was so thrilled to hear from me! We made a date for coffee at the little shop that's part of our community. When I walked in, I could spot her right away. I could see the family resemblance right away! We must have talked for three hours! Turns out after she left, she got in with a bad crowd, but turned her life around after she got pregnant. She raised her kid the best she could (he turned out great and such a handsome young man!) and worked her way up to head buyer for her company.

He had gotten a new job, and I decided the rainy city would be a good place for me to start my own career . The first week we moved into our small one bedroom apartment everything was great. My boyfriend loved his job, we were finally finished unpacking, and a company called me back about an interview. But reality settled in pretty quickly one day when I realized: I had made this move for the benefit of my boyfriend and not myself. He had friends in Seattle whether or not  it be coworkers at his job, or cool people he meet through work. As for me, I had no friends or family. This was made abundantly clear on crisp fall afternoon. I remember the day clearly. I had spent most of the day hold up in our tiny  apartment preparing for my interview.  My boyfriend had called earlier and the day. He said Kia and Chad, a couple in his department, had invited us out for drinks. I was excited because it was my first night going out in the city with other people besides my boyfriend. So, prepping for my interview was really just away to kill time. To be honest I was not so enthusiastic  about the company as I once was when we first moved. As the time got closer, I donned my best dress and slipped into my favorite shoes. I was freshening up in the mirror when my boyfriend called to meet him at the location. I arrived to indie bar on the other side of town. The bar was upscale without being obnoxious . I was offered a drink as soon as I sat at the bar. My boyfriend and his friends arrived. We got a table, order a round and some appetizers. They were great people, but most of the time I felt left out the conversation, as they only talked about work, or insides office jokes.My boyfriend was not accommodating or tried to included me in their conversation. Eventually, we decided to go to a night club. We all hoped into an UBER, since we would be drinking for the night and didn't want to take the risk of driving. The nightclub was fun, but later into the night I lost my boyfriend and didn't see his friends either As almost two hours went buy, I realized my boyfriend left me alone in a crowded nightclub by myself, with no way home, and no friends in the area.","I, a college aged female, moved from a small town to a large northern city to live with my boyfriend.

There were many nice paintings but there was on in particular that caught my eye. It was a painting of birds and watermelons. The brush strokes were detailed and smooth. The colors were muted but still seemed to pop out at you. The lines and definition were precise but also looked blended so that each object moved seamlessly into the other. i wanted to know who painted this. the plaque under the painting told me the name of the painting and the painter.

Once we settled into our room we returned to the lobby to check out the activity desk.  Since we had never been on a boating trip we decided to take the off island boat trip to a small undeveloped tiny island where we would have food and drinks prepared by the boat captain.  We headed out early the next morning to meet with the boat captain and leave for our excursion.  The captain was a middle aged man with a pleasant demeanor.  The waters were a little choppy that day and the kids ended up getting sea sick.  I thought to myself please let this boat trip end soon.  The captain let us off at the small island while he stayed aboard to cook us lunch. My family and I went snorkeling and saw some beautiful sea life all around us.  The kids and I were amazed at how beautiful this little piece of paradise was.  We got out of the ocean and dried off.  There were a few sprinkles to start but nothing major.  We were getting hungry and could smell the food being prepared on the captains boat.  All of the sudden a huge gust of wind came barreling through, the skies darkened and the waves picked up.  It started pouring rain as the boat started sloshing back and forth through the waves.  The storm caused the anchor on the boat to become unhinged and the boat was adrift without an anchor.  The captain tried to get the boat close enough to shore but was fighting off every inch of water and waves.  After about four hours the sea calmed and my husband swam out to the boat and was able to bring the small dingy to get us from the island to the boat. We made it back to the resort unharmed.

3FQ5JJ512MAKGUUG8CB5VNADY7UKNN,After waiting for so long I am finally an aunt!! Two months ago my brother and his lovely wife gave birth to a beautiful baby girl and they name her Claudia after our great grandmother. I was so surprised when they told me they were going to have a baby. They tried for a long time and really had thought they would never be parents. So many times they had to go to the fertility clinic and they would get their hopes up just to be disappointed.  But finally our little miracle arrived. I was so proud of my brother and how he handles the birth of his child. I was lucky enough to be invited into the delivery room. It was really amazing to watch the birth of little Claudia and Jill my brothers wife was so brave. She really did a great job. Claudia is now two months old and she is just amazing. She is so beautiful and sweet. It kind of makes me feel bad I never had any children of my own and probably never will. I chose to have a career and didn't really give much time to my personal relationships. But I absolutely love being an aunt. I have kept her on a few occasions so my brother and Jill can go out and get some much needed couple time. I do have to admit I like that I can have baby time then they pick her up and I have me time.,I am an Aunt! My brother and his wife finally had a baby after years so trying.  So now I can live vicariously through them since I will probably never have any kids of my own.,60.0

I had been waiting all year for this event as I love horses. The horses were amazing and so majestic. A friend of mine is a rider and agreed to take me behind the scenes to see what it takes to get the horses ready to show. Everyone was very friendly and seeing the horses up close was a dream come true. Most of the horses were getting groomed and saddled up for the show. As we were walking out of the barn we were following many of the horses and riders. I was talking to my friend and looking around at all the stalls, not watching where I was walking. Next thing I knew I felt like I was on ice and sliding around. I was trying to stay standing but before I could grab something I slipped and fell down. I was laying flat on my back and to my surprise everyone was laughing. I started to get up and slipped again. I had actually slipped on horse manure and was not lying in it. My backside was completely covered in horse manure. I never thought to bring a change of clothes, my clothers were covered in horse manure and I totally smelled. I politely excused myself and told my friend I would have to go home to shower and change. She had a slight smile on her face and said she understood. I was so embarrassed and couldn't wait to leave. I will have to wait another year to attend this event and I will remember to take a spare set of clothes.","I attended an American Quarter Horse show in April, 2019. The show was amazing.

They got engaged last summer, and it reminds me now of when my wife and I introduced them to each other.

After a short while we were having my mother come stay with us. Knowing my mother I know she likes this to be particular. She also really loves our home state and doesn't want to move from it. She's a New Englander through and through but feels that some of the major states, like Mass and NY are too busy for her. Anyway, she arrived the Friday and would be staying for a week.

I think she really took too and enjoy the time being in a new city and state and being around different people. After the days rolled by and we spent our evenings together she got really involved. She cooked in our kitchen, made a meal for us, we drank lots of wine and watched movies on the couch. We just enjoyed the cool evenings of summer out on our patio, by the fire, cooking outside and having fun.

My girlfriend and I had been dating for about 8 years and decided it was time to take a nice vacation for just the two of us.  After discussing it for a while I found out she had never been to a beach, so we decided to head to Miami.  She was so excited and everything was perfect, however there was another reason I wanted to take this vacation.  I decided that she was the love of my life and it was high time that I went ahead and asked her to marry me. So I found the perfect beach in Miami for us and decided this would be where I popped the question.  After the flight, we checked into our hotels around 5pm and decided to go out to eat before we went to the beach. I got the ring ready, and decided it was about time to make the biggest decision of my life. Dinner was amazing, I had the fried calamari and she ordered the baked salmon.  I saw the gleam in her eyes and debated whether to ask here then and there.  Something in me told me that the beach would be the perfect place, so I decided to wait. After dinner we got changed and headed to the beach, when she saw the sunset her eyes lit up and you could tell that she was amazed at what she saw.  I figured this was the best time, so I grabbed her hand and got down on one Knee.  Her hand pressed quickly over her mouth as I finally got the nerve to ask ""would you marry me"".  Tears ran down her cheek and as she shivered with excitement nodded her head and said ""Yes"".

Eight years together and we've been through a lot, and nothing to make me think at all about breaking up. But it had to be a special moment when I finally asked her the question, and I just couldn't think how to make it something really memorable. I didn't want to propose when we were out for pizza or something ordinary like that! And then when we talked about going to the beach for a vacation, that just seemed so perfect. I knew I had to do it. The beach vacation was everything I thought it would be, and something so special to her as it was her first time. Walking along the boardwalk, playing the games, and of course the beach itself. She was so happy, having an absolute blast whether we were relaxing on the sand or playing in the water. So finally the perfect opportunity presented itself. We decided on the spur of the moment to go for a walk along the beach and enjoy the sunset, then get dinner afterwards. Thank goodness I had an excuse to wear something with pockets! I had the ring of course, and when we walked around one crop of rocks and saw the sun sparkling across the water, we both just stopped and looked for a few moments. That was it, I knew it'd never be more romantic than that. So of course I did the whole down-on-one-knee thing, which was goofy but it just felt right. As soon as that happened she knew what was coming and she started tearing up, and I don't know what I said but she said yes and it was perfect, absolutely perfect.

I didn't really have it in me to write a long tale about anything, but I also didn't feel inspired to write a short story.

When I decided to just write and see what came out, it came out disjointed. Nothing really made much sense regardless and it was a flowing sea of words that were choppy like waves. Soon, I realize that maybe I was thinking about this all wrong. I thought how writing like Bukowski is different than writing in the style of him. His style is very unique and I really love how he tells stories. Maybe his style is a little disjointed, much like my writing in the class was becoming.

Like one person would drive this week and then another would drive next week and the next week I would drive, etc. That way no one person had to put the mileage on their car and we all chipped in for gas. I was so thankful that I met that group, because I was really having trouble making ends meet with how much gas I was using making those trips.

3TPWUS5F8ANSKQR680LU3NAWM83WCN,"Three months ago, I was there to witness something that I had been occasionally thinking about since the first day that I had become a father. My son stood tall and proud in an Eagle Scout ceremony. The day started out as usual, I said good morning to my son and asked him how excited he was for his big day. He responded exactly like I thought he would, casual, but not wanting to hurt my feelings. Ever since he was young, being an Eagle Scout is something that he’s been interested in. I was an Eagle Scout myself when I was younger but I made sure that I didn’t push the idea onto him; this is something that I wanted him to do through his own free will. We both finished getting ready and headed to the ceremony. We arrived and went our separate ways, him to the scout area so that he could get ready and myself to the bleachers were an abundance of prideful parents sat. Though there was nothing particularly special or different about this ceremony, I just couldn’t help but feel so proud of my son standing on that stage. He’s worked hard for this moment and it’s something that really means something to him. The most memorable part about it to me was when they had each scout walk up to the microphone and explain what being an Eagle Scout means to them personally. A lot of the answers were expected and a little generic, but when he stood on that stage and began to speak, you could tell that he really meant every word of what he was saying. It brought me back to the days of my youth. All of the times I spent with my scout mates, the hard work that we put ourselves through to be the best that we could be; it was almost overwhelming. For that hour long ceremony, I felt like I had gone back in time. Though I would never tell my son this directly due to the fear of embarrassing him, I see a lot of myself in him; and this experience in my life has done nothing but confirm it. After all was said and done, the ceremony proceeded to end. I stepped off of the bleachers and patiently waited. He walked up to me and I gave him the biggest hug I have in a while. He excitedly told me everything that had been going on behind the scenes and I told him how proud I was of him and how glad I was that he’s found something that truly makes him happen at this early stage in his life. We left the ceremony area and headed back to the car so that we could go home. I’d like to believe that I’ve been doing my best as a father but no one is perfect. My son has grown into a fine young man and though I probably could have done better in some aspects, I am incredibly proud of him. Being an Eagle Scout isn’t something that means much to most, but to us, it’s an honor and a privilege. I love my son and know that he will continue to become the man that he’s destined to be.","During my son's Eagle Scout ceremony, I felt an extreme sense of pride and gladness.

Both Dianne and Wilma (my sister-in-laws) gleefully (rightly so) announced they were having more children.  It is their 3rd and 5th child respectively.       I am, myself, unable to have children.  Since this revelation, I thought I had come to terms with this, but apparently not, as I found myself having to excuse myself as I became overwhelmed with sadness.  I was more surprised by my reaction to the news, than to the actual news.     Since this time, I've reflected on the event, and my reaction to it.  I've tried to take what manifested as a painful experience for me, and turn it into a positive.  I've come to the conclusion that I don't want to have children, so there's no reason to let this news have this effect on me.  Further, under more rational thought, having calmed down, I know that due to advances in science, there are other, non-traditional means for me to have children should I change my mind.  I could also always look into adoption.  The best thing to come out of this introspection, is the reminder that this is a joyous event.  I will soon have two new nieces or nephews that I can spoil, and then send home.

It was my first time and although I had read about the event, nothing could have prepared me for how much fun it was. One event in particular really stood out. There was a guy dressed in a professional level Hulk Buster Iron Man suit complete with lights and everything. He was surrounded by people admiring his costume and folks requesting selfies, me being one of them i'm not ashamed to admit. While I was standing there next to this giant Iron Man costume getting my selfie, a little girl, no more than 7 years old, stepped out from the perimeter of interested fans. She stepped forward with two foam Hulk fists on her hands, both toy fists nearly as big as she, and proclaimed ""HULK SMASH!"". The crowd bursted into laughter, as did I. As I stepped out of the way, the little girl pounced forward and began punching the Iron Man's leg with her foam fists. The man in the Iron Man outfit, being a good sport, decided to put on a show and duke it out with the little She Hulk. I was able to catch the action on my cell phone but of course the video was shaky due to my uncontrollable laughter. After the staged fight I stepped aside to reflect on the brawl I had witnessed and it got me to thinking. I started thinking about my own life and how this event is such a strong metaphor to my day to day. I am just one small person in a whole wide world, fighting against injustices, prejudice, and those telling me I won't ever achieve my dreams, yet this little girl so clearly showed that no matter your size or position in life, you can overcome the greatest of obstacles.

But I remember being disappointed the first time I saw Depeche Mode, as well as a NIN concert I saw, each of which were only 90 minutes. If you've got a 30-45 minute set then I'd say about 7-10 songs, depending on how long your songs are, and how much stage banter you do.

I began my cross-country journey a few months ago, living out of a camper van, driving across what seems to be an endless stretch of desert. Life alone is not easy, especially for a divorcee starting over in her 'golden years'.  I normally pull over and eat a quick sandwich in the car, but yesterday, I was just too tired to deal with eat, and really craved the presence of other people for a change. I was happy to see a small but run-down diner on the horizon around lunchtime. When I walked into the smoke-filled diner, a young waitress with a pulled-back pony tail greeted me with a jagged-tooth smile and handed me a menu as she walked me to my booth. I noticed a scant number of other diners seated randomly in the restaurant. As I sat and studied the greasy menu, i happened to peer over the top, feeling the gaze of someone on me. I saw a man sitting at the counter, staring straight at me. He was 50-something, with a tousle of salt-and-pepper hair peeking out from the brim of his cowboy hat. He was dressed simply in blue jeans and a starched shirt, wearing a belt with a large silver buckle. He did not break his gaze on me, as he sipped slowly on a cup of coffee.

The man I had known my entire life, looked up to my entire life, just no longer existed. Something that I had always known was there, suddenly was not. It was difficult to deal with, as most death is, but his spirit and the memories I have of him will never disappear. And I learned this a week later, when things finally came to it's normalcy. I had spent the entire day hanging out in the yard and the hills and decided to go up that evening and dig up some of my childhood toys for the kids and there it was, the pistol my dad bought me when I was a kid. It was a piece of crap, of course; rusted and dusted. A children's toy meant to shoot wooden pellets, something I'm sure the political correctness of this generation would frown on. I brought the gun down from the attic and told my son to come over and bring his friends and I taught them out to use it. They had watched us old fogeys shoot on the range for the better portion of the day, I suppose their turn was coming. The moldy box of pellets still had a few usable pieces of ammunition and I drew a bulls-eye on the side of the house and let them play target practice. A couple of times, I had to warn the kids of the safety of pointing it in each other's face but watching them play with a potentially dangerous yet fun piece of my childhood brought those tears and memories right back to me. The times we had were well spent. The times I'm having with my kid and someone else's kids are also well spent. So, this was when I realized that this is how things are supposed to be.

He told me that is the reason he wanted me to take the role of the teacher. His believed this experience would help me understand the teachings of the Bible and at the same time benefit the children. After careful consideration, I agreed to teach Vacation Bible School. I must say this endeavor turned out to be one of the best decisions I have ever made. I was assigned to a class of 7-9 year-olds. The children in this age group were inquisitive and full of wonder. I immersed myself fully into each lesson. The decision that I made to undertake this challenge was one of the best I have ever made. I learned more about the Bible during that week than I had learned in my entire life. The children were responsible for opening my mind up to all the things that were confusing to me concerning the teachings of the Bible.  The children had an awareness that I hadn't before this week of teaching. They graciously shared their stories and opinions on the lessons I was teaching. That was one of the best weeks in my life.

She took a pretty hard fall and it really scared me. It did not take her long to get right back up and get her focus back to where it needed to be. The look on her dad's face went from fear and concern to a genuine look of admiration almost immediately. It turned out to be a great learning experience and we plan to do it again next week. We will most likely be going every week for a while. We live in an area that is warm almost all year. This is a great goal for my daughter for where we live. She knows that we will support her all the way.","My daughter has some difficult skateboarding goals and is working hard towards them.

She was having a lot of difficulty reaching one of her skateboarding goals.  Her goal was to learn how to drop in on a large quarter pipe.  In one of her attempts, she fell pretty hard.  Her knees were bruised.  I was afraid she broke one of her arms but luckily that was not the case.  She got up and recollected herself.  We made sure she wasn't hurt too badly.

He didn't used to be much for alcohol, but he is going through a really rough divorce right now, and he is not coping very well. This is my husband's brother, so I am not any closer to his wife than I am to him. I first noticed how much he was drinking when I stopped by the apartment he is renting until the divorce is final. There were beer cans everywhere, and even though it was noon, my relative was still in his pajamas and he looked like hell. I asked him if he was doing okay, and he pretty much told me to get lost. I told my husband how worried I was about his brother when I got home, and suggested he talk to him.  The next thing I know, my husband is telling me he is going to take his brother out with some friends to help get his mind off the divorce and drama. What an idiot! I think his brother has a drinking problem, and my husband is going to take him out to drink. How dumb can you get? I was wrong however.

3FTF2T8WLS4QMSK3WGB31X9NSFZW9Z,"Dear diary,Two weeks ago today I was in pain myself, I felt depressed and didn't know how I was going to go on. Even though I was hurting I had friends and family who depended on me. I had no other choice but to be strong for everyone else. I had to push my pain aside to help those that I love deal with their pain. It is funny that when I thought I was doing something just for my friends and family I was actually doing something for myself too. Pushing my feelings aside and helping others I was some how able to deal with this pain and tragedy when I thought I couldn't. Allowing myself to think and put someone else first actually helped me to sort my feelings out subconsciously. Sharing someone else's burden may be one of the best decisions I have ever made, it sure helped me to deal with my thoughts and feelings in a more positive way than usual. From now on I vow to always help others no matter what I am going through and maybe sadness will have no control over my life anymore. I can gather comfort in being someone that is strong and able to lift other people i care about up in their times of need. Sometimes caring for others more than yourself is the best thing you can do as a friend and a help. You don't realize I guess until the horrible tragedy calms down or passes that you actually have dealt with it in a positive way and that you have helped someone else in probably the best way you could. I think God designs us that way. I think we are made to be servants of not only him but his people. I think through his purpose that is how we can gain comfort in such a horrible time. Had I not stepped up to help them I would have been at home in bed wallowing in sadness and depression with little comfort. I can proudly say this time diary, I didn't do that. I was the strongest one!","In time of tragedy and sadness, I was able to find comfort by helping others deal with their pain.

We started the morning off by going on a long walk around the neighborhood. I let Jesse stop and sniff as many times as he wanted. When we got back home I gave him his favorite dry kibble topped with eggs and bacon I had prepared. We then hopped in my Jeep and headed to the ocean, one of Jesse's favorite spots. I threw his ball into the water over and over again until he got tired and we both rested on the cool sand. We then walked side by side along the ocean, taking in the cool breeze and salty air. After that we got back in my Jeep and drove to a local dog bakery where I bought him his all time favorite carob and peanut butter bone shaped cookie. He gobbled it down as I sat on the bench smiling at him. A woman and her child came by and asked if they could pet him. I said ""of course"" because Jesse loved people and any attention he got from them. The little girl rubbed his ears and gave him a kiss. We decided to head home and lay on the couch together and took a nap. That night I gave him his favorite wet dog food and we snuggled in my bed together.

We talked about all the times we had together growing up. We spent almost every weekend together . After high school we both went to different universities . We called each other almost every day.  She met a wonderful guy at college and they are planning to get married once they both get their degree. Our dinner together meant so much to me . I wanted her to meet my partner, I knew they would love each other. We went to the beach and hung out together for several days. She makes me laugh like we are teens again. My partner loved seeing that side of me. She promised next visit she would bring her fiancee with her. He sounds wonderful from the way she talks about him. Of course she asked me to be her maid of honor. I told her I would love to, that it would be a honor to stand with her. She has left now and I miss her already. I will call her tonight, but its not the same as her being here. Writing this makes me feel sad. I feel a tear streaming down my cheek. Soon my partner and I will visit her and meet this new guy. I cant wait to see her again. We both are so lucky to have each other and a special partner in our lives. I wonder what it would have been like if we had chosen the same university? I often think about that. What a great birthday, I will always remember it.","My best friend visits me from out-of-state for the first time in years for my birthday.

It is odd to me to see her room empty here at the house and know that she won't live here with us again.  I am so happy and excited she is growing up and living her life.  But, still it is hard.  I know she will come and visit us, but the house feels so empty.  I understand it's only been a month, so it is difficult.  Knowing that in a few months this will feel like normal helps get me through this hard time.  Everything changes.  But, I am so glad she is becoming an adult.  She will enjoy college.

I figured it was worth a shot, and decided to contact the home owners by letter. I told them about how I imagined raising a family there. I wrote about how I dreamed of having children and pushing them on the old tire swing in the front yard. I must have pulled one of their heart strings because they accepted my offer.

On occasion she will even come over and cook dinner for us. We would bake together, or just sit and chat over a cup of coffee. She is my only daughter and I'm not sure how much we'll get to see her.

It was the most heartbreaking day of my life. I was expected to speak at his service and I didn't know what to do because I hadn't stopped crying since I got the phone call that he had unexpectedly passed away. I searched my heart and my brain to find something to say but for the life of me I couldn't stop crying long enough to get anything out onto paper much less anything that I could get up in front of everyone and say. I just decided that I would go with the flow and try to come up with what to say on the spot. That was a disaster. From the minute I walked up to the podium I started crying and could barely get a word out in between sobs. Once I got calmed down a bit I tried to talk about all the good times and memories that I had with my father and I got a few out before I had to take a break. I told about the times when we used to go riding around in his mustang and the time he let me move it in my grandmother's driveway and freaked out because he thought I was gonna hit that big tree. I talked about how much he loved his grandkids and how he would take them fishing and teach them how to work on cars. I talked about how he put off his retirement for years and we all knew it was because he loved his job regardless of how much he claimed to hate it. I knew he would be proud of me for standing up in front of everyone talking like that. He knew I had terrible anxiety but I was glad I was able to control it long enough to talk about him and what he meant to me. When I finally said everything I was able to say I went back to my seat where I collapsed into my mother's arms and cried for the rest of the service.,My father died and I had to deliver a message during the service.  I dealt with extreme emotions and sadness during the event.,28.0

The ceremony was a small get together at my parent's. We only invited close family and friends: about 25 people. John's parents were so happy for him. My mom cried and cried. I'm glad we decided not to keep it small and manageable: I would have been way more nervous than I already was if it was some big extravaganza. In fact, I was so nervous I had to hire some catering.

My husband's family members who joined in the party came from far away.  I think almost ten people altogether showed up to wish her a happy birthday.  Judith and her new husband Max had prepared a feast for everyone.  The barbeque was lit in the backyard and all day we enjoyed hamburgers cooked to order.  I talked to Judith for awhile and caught up on everything.  I hadn't seen her in so long that it was a surprise for me to see how much weight she had lost and how healthy she looked.

I could see that my husband was enjoying himself.  In the afternoon, some of the older kids took the younger ones out for ice cream at the local mall while the adults stayed home and sat in the living room talking to one another.  During the party, we learned from Judith that she was planning on retiring from her job later this year.  This would give her and her new husband more time to travel around the country sightseeing.  I was so happy for her.  In the late evening, we all gathered around the fire in the backyard and made s'mores.  My favorite part of this birthday party was when my husband's aunt opened up her gifts.  This year my husband and I had gotten her a set of teacups.

I come visit once a year, but I don't usually get to spend this much time here, which was great!  I grew up here in a semi rural community, but my parents got a great job offer in NY so we moved to Albany.  We still have a cabin up here out in the woods not too far from where I grew up so that's where I stay when I (or we!) come visit.  I spent the first few days of the trip just getting settled in with my dog Sasha, and we did a lot of hiking around.   I love nature and even seeing the same places when I come, they are always still just as beautiful. I had been going through a bit of a rough patch since I broke up with my gf of 3 years and this was exactly what I needed. Speaking of, the festival itself was fantastic.  I hooked up with a few people still left in town from HS that I grew up with and the first day we pregamed pretty good before we went.  They had plenty of live music and people from all over the state came with almost anything you could want.  My favorite parts were the garlic and cheese sections, the garlic people were set up in front on days 1 and 2 while the cheese folks were in the spotlight on days 4 and 5.  One of my friends actually got me to be on the panel for judging dishes there as well, which I couldn't thank them for enough.

The Law Office of Hamlin Hamlin and McGill gave me a shot as a junior attorney to try one of the biggest medical malpractice cases the office had ever seen. Mr McGill himself  worked closely with me on this case. We worked so hard, it was so stressful. At times, I thought we were going to lose. Mr McGill told me to just keep my cool and don't worry about those little pitfalls in the case. He told me, just keep your eye on the finish line. Keep delivering the facts to the jury and the facts will speak for themselves. And boy was he right! Even through all the stress, this was such an amazing and fun experience. I learned so much from this. And we won the largest verdict the firm has ever seen. We won $65 million dollars! At our firm, we are not greedy like many other law firms out there, so our client was stunned to find out that they will be taking home $40 million of that! My cut of that is a cool $1 million!

I invited my friend to come along since he had never really been out of the city.  It was a great time of year to go because it was just after winter and there weren't a lot of other tourists there yet.  The weather was a little bit chilly in the mornings and at night but we hiked all along Oak Creek which will definitely warm you up. We found a cool place to swim, too. The water was freezing but after exploring all around the rocks and getting all sweaty, it was really refreshing.  My friend was fascinated by everything and took a million pictures.  There are a ton of little trails to explore and we set up a base camp near the creek to come back to after checking things out on a bunch of them.  On the last night we had a little bit of a scare when we were lying in the tent and heard something walking around outside.  My sister stayed with my friend and I got to be the brave one to investigate with the flashlight.  It is really dark out there at night when there isn't much of a moon. I didn't dare go to far from the tent because I had no idea if there might be bears or something.  I was shining the light around and suddenly saw two glowing eyes.  I was about to freak out when the animal moo'd at me.  It was a cow!  There we were out there in what seemed like the wilderness and a domestic cow just ambled on into our campsite.  I went back into the tent to tell the others and the cow just kind of wandered off.

Diary, I have told you about how he was a suspected rapist and I know he used hard drugs and lied all of the time about where he was and what he did, but my new boyfriend, Steve, has been the light of my life lately. I'm so lucky to have Steve. We met at the Farmer's Market. He's tall and handsome, and smiles a lot. I was with Jeff the day I met Steve, and Jeff became insanely jealous immediately. I barely tried to hide my attraction to Steve and even mentioned it to Jeff. I said ""He's cute"". That morning, I was slapped by Jeff so hard after we got back to our car, in the parking lot of the Farmer's Market. I would usually feel the tears welling up in my eyes immediately but not that morning. I got out of the car and walked inside and handed my business card directly to Steve and told him ""Call me, I want to get coffee with you, tonight?"" and he sort of smiled and shrugged as picked up some cardboard boxes and said ""Cool, is it ok to call this afternoon?"" and I smiled and said ""of course it is!"". I walked out of the parking lot, past Jeff's car. Jeff followed me for a while, and begged me to get into his car but I just ignored him and kept walking through the snow on the sidewalk.

I was scared that that would be the last time I saw her. I thought about all the times that we had shared together and it was overwhelming and unbearable for me. My family just could not find the sympathy to understand how I felt and acted as though I didn't care about her passing, when that was the furthest from the truth.

We split our time pretty evenly between the city and the country: about a week in the cities and a week and a half in the countryside. I enjoyed the cities a lot more, especially those museums! My very favorite was the Hermitage in St. Petersburg. An absolutely stunning collection of art! Though while I did like the cities a bit more, going to the country was pretty meaningful, especially for dad. He was so excited to show me the little village where he spent his childhood. I got to meet some (very!) extended family members, some of whom I had no idea even existed. It was really touching to see my dad so happy; I could really feel how much he missed this country, and how deep his roots run there. I have to admit, I was a little worried about safety before going, but everything was mostly okay! There was only one instance in which I was a little scared. One night in Moscow, around 12 AM, we were walking home from a bar and a man stepped out of the shadows. He demanded to see our papers (passport, visa, etc.) and was generally pretty menacing.

Being married so young and so quickly like myself, sometimes you learn things you never got a chance to know, and things you wish just weren't true. I am 26, and my wife is about to turn 23. We were married quite young at 21 and 18, respectively. We both had our expectations going into this, but communication was always a problem from the start. I had the expectation of committing to a partner that would put their best foot forward and do whatever it takes to help us be successful. Unfortunately, she was just looking for someone to take care of her. This became evident pretty quickly when she refused to find work. We were living with her father at the time which was a very uncomfortable situation for the both of us. While I slaved away jumping from dead end job to dead end job, she continued to do nothing to help us. Even bringing up the idea of going job hunting was enough to ensue a shouting match, a crying fit, ecetera. Eventually I just stopped trying.

When we eventually drove off we both locked eyes and kind of expressed the same level of astonishment to each other as we parted. It was all very surreal, and something I've never experienced before in this area.

3BF51CHDTWWQT8111L6A7JY8YVA0HF,"My oldest daughter starting Kindergarten was one of the most teeth chattering mornings of my life. Her mother and I had the talks with her. We know that she's a smart kid, and generally stays out of trouble. But this is a rough school district, and it can't be said for sure that every single person is safe. I took the day off from work so that I could drop my daughter off myself. I know that I can't do this every day and she'll eventually need to take the bus, but I wanted her to have some sense of familiarity. My daughter was fearless. As much as we warned her to stay clear of trouble, she didn't fully grasp the concept of how dangerous this school is. Truth be told, I didn't want to lay it all out on the table for her. Perhaps I lulled her into a false sense of security? But more likely this is a childlike, innocent fearlessness. She grew up in this rough neighborhood, but of course we always kept a very close eye on her, and she hasn't had to face many of the harsh realities of ""the hood"".One day I'll get her out of this neighborhood. She'll be able to ride the bus to and from school every day without being exposed to the ugliness around her. The homeless, the addicts, the criminals. My daughter deserves better, but I can't give it to her just yet. As she steps out of the car and skips into her class, all I can hope is that this school does not break her.","My oldest daughters first day of kindergarten. While we were all apprehensive, she was the most confident.",7.0
3OXV7EAXLFC6DBGHOPXPCQ7O2Y163K,"I lived the typical American fantasy. I met my future wife to be in high school. The chemistry was white hot. I had wanted this to happen growing up and reaching the ranks in the school system. But those ideas were just that: ideas. They didn't seem like they'd be a reality. But then, she came into my life. I didn't really believe in the idea of love at first sight, but that was before I met her. She was the proverbial girl of my dreams. A few years later, we were married. It all had happened so fast. But that's what made it even more special. It was full speed ahead. It just is nice to take a step back and appreciate what all has happened. We've had a couple kids since the marriage, and to this day I am still just as much in love with her as I was the day I saw her. In fact, it grows by the day. I got incredibly lucky.",The diary was about the day i got married to my wife. Who I met in highschool. and enjoying our best life now with our 2 children.,150.0
3HWRJOOET6OEA7UBKMHOWM7DB4LSE0,"What a long journey I've been on. These last 5 months since my mother's funeral have been very difficult and emotional.  I think the most difficult part was trying to control my feelings during the funeral, while everyone around me was crying and melancholic.  My black dress was stained with the tears of not only myself, but many others as well. But, the most memorable thing was how everyone took the time to comfort one another and provide support like nothing I've every seen. The amount of compassion exhibited was extraordinary. I don't think I've every received so many hugs and condolences in my life.  It was quite an unusual thing to experience. I have thought about it many times over the last 5 months. I have even spoken to several of those who attended since that time. It is still hard to adjust to her being gone, but she will never be forgotten. I look at her pictures often and it still puts a smile on my face, yet makes me tear up at the same time. I find many conversation are now geared toward remembering her and how she made everyone laugh. Those are the best memories to remember. This is what will always remain in my heart and mind.",We held a memorial for my Mother this past March. She passed away from bone marrow cancer 5 years ago. It was a very emotional gathering for everyone.,150.0
3TPZPLC3M1YENHYM3LWYIQY6O9OP3B,"The birth of my son was an experience I'll never forget. I woke up early that day, around 5am. The weather was unseasonably warm as I stepped outside to head to the gym to get a swim in. Baby Cameron, the name my husband and I had picked out soon after I found out I was pregnant, was taking his time being born. The night before, my husband and I had discussed our options for inducing birth if it didn't happen naturally this week. I was scared because I had read that induction can cause complications. That of course didn't need to happen, thankfully. Maybe the shock of the cold water or the mild exercise induced labor, but as soon as I stepped out of the pool I felt my first contraction. I immediately called my husband. He rushed from home where he was getting ready from work to pick me up and take me into the hospital. When we arrived at the hospital I was immediately taken to a delivery room. The doctor I had chosen for my birth was thankfully on duty at the time and was able to come in right away. He checked my cervix and announced that the baby would come soon. The next few hours that followed were a blur of pain and hard work. I opted for a natural birth with no medication, and I'm glad I did. It wasn't fun, but I got to fully experience the wonder of birth. My husband was at my side the entire time while I squeezed his hand. Finally, at 11:01am, Cameron was born. He was a beautiful baby with a thick head of black hair. He has his father's eyes, and my button nose. The nurses all said he was the most handsome baby they had ever seen. After nine months of waiting, I couldn't believe that it only took five hours for my son to arrive. We stayed overnight at the hospital so that his health could be monitored. A breast feeding specialist came in to make sure Cameron was latching that morning. After that, we were able to head home with our new son.",This is event was when I gave birth to my son. He was born four months ago. He came so fast into this world it was only a 5 hour birth.,120.0
3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSMYPVLPX,"I spoke with Derek again today and he's doing better. His cast comes off in another couple of days and he's excited to get to walk without crutches. The damn cast was a menace to society! There have been tons of times when he's swung that thing around and nearly tripped me. It's also riddled with dirty drawings scribbled in marker and jokes poking fun at him falling off a cliff. I still can't believe he took that tumble, but Derek likes to act fearless. I also think he might have been a little drunk, but I could never really be sure. The strangest part is that it was a cliff that we've climbed a hundred times before. I have no idea how he slipped in a way that propelled him off the cliff face and onto the ground below. That's why I think he may have been drinking beforehand, it wouldn't be out of the realm of possibilities. When he hit the ground, we did chuckle a little bit. It didn't look like that bad of a fall and he landed on a soft part of the ground. Once he started moaning and whimpering, we knew it was pretty bad. We quickly ran down to check on him and his leg was bent up behind him in a very unnatural way. We had to call for an ambulance and they came into the park and took him out on a stretcher. That was almost two months ago and he's finally getting back to some normalcy. He hated having the cast at first but eventually it started to get him attention. Each time he told the story of how he fell, it got wilder and wilder. At one point I think he included something about a fight with a bear, but no one believed that version of the story. I'm happy that the fall didn't permanently injure him. I hope he learns to be more careful in the future.","Some friends and I went rock climbing. One of my friends fell 20 ft to the ground, and broke his leg. He couldn't use it for a while, but was okay.",60.0
